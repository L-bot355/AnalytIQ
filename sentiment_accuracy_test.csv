5431,2011-09,"Thank you for the invitation to speak to you this morning. It is a pleasure to be in the North East and to have the opportunity to speak to a forum of business leaders from the manufacturing sector. As our economy recovers and rebalances towards a more sustainable pattern of growth and demand, manufacturing and the export sector more generally will need to play an increasing role. So I'm really pleased to have the opportunity to speak to a group of companies at the forefront of this process. The topic of my talk today is one that is close to many of your hearts. Indeed, it concerns the life blood of the long-term success of each and every one of your companies. It is also central to the setting of monetary policy. As you know far better than I, strong, sustained productivity growth is vital for ensuring that your companies remain competitive in the global market place. Productivity is equally important for the long-term health and prosperity of our economy as a whole. To paraphrase one economist ""productivity isn't everything, but in the long-run it is almost everything"". Productivity matters for monetary policy since it plays a crucial role in determining the supply capacity of our economy. The balance between an economy's capacity to supply goods and services and what is actually demanded is a fundamental driver of inflationary pressure in the medium term, and so central to the MPC's task. The recent behaviour of productivity has been puzzling and worrying in equal measure.  The level of measured productivity in the UK private sector today is lower than it was at the time of the financial crisis. We have had over three years of stagnant productivity. If private sector productivity had continued to grow at the average rate seen prior to the crisis of around two and half percent or so, the level of productivity today would be around 9% higher (Chart 1). What might account for the UK's productivity shortfall? And what implications might it have for monetary As I fear may often seem to be the case with economists - I'm not going to offer you a simple answer. There is no single smoking gun. Rather I think there are a number of candidate explanations, each of which is likely to have played some role. In the next section of my talk, I'll highlight three broad classes of explanation - which range from the relatively benign to more worrying diagnoses - and try to provide some guide as to their relative importance. I'll then discuss how the uncertainty surrounding recent developments in productivity complicates the setting of monetary policy. The MPC needs to form an assessment of the strength of supply as well as demand when setting policy. I'll conclude with some thoughts on recent developments in the economy more generally and how they have affected my policy decisions. So what could account for the recent poor productivity performance? One possibility is that the weakness of measured productivity growth may exaggerate the true extent of underlying weakness. Let me explain. An encouraging aspect of the recent recession is that although unemployment increased, it rose by far less than we might have feared given the depth of the recession. The recent data on employment and unemployment are worrying in that context, with unemployment edging up over the summer, after having previously fallen by over 50,000 from its peak in early 2010. If this weakening in the labour market continues that could materially change the relationship between output and employment.  But to date, companies appeared to have held onto a greater proportion of their labour force than in past recessions. My own experience of speaking to businesses at the depth of the recession is that this was driven by a desire to retain valuable skills and experience. Many companies had learned from past experience how difficult it is to re-employ skilled workers once let go. But a consequence of this labour hoarding is that the amount of output produced per worker fell very sharply, in many cases partly because working hours were cut back. And although there has been some rebound since then, the level of labour productivity has still not recovered to its previous level. This greater retention of labour suggests that firms may be sitting on a substantial degree of spare capacity. Underlying productivity - the level of productivity that would be possible if workers and capital were utilised at normal levels of intensity - may have continued to improve even though measured productivity has not. But this will only become apparent if and when demand recovers and the workforce is fully utilised. Although I place some weight on this explanation, I worry that it is contradicted by what business leaders - just like you - typically say and, more importantly, by what they have been doing. Despite all this apparent hoarding of labour, when responding to business surveys and questions from our network of Agents, companies often say that they have relatively little spare capacity. Now there are good reasons why a company's notion of spare capacity may differ from that of an economist, and so there's a danger that we over-interpret these responses. But it is not just what the managers of those businesses say, it is also what they have been doing. Over the past year, despite only sluggish output growth, private sector employment increased by almost half a million people - the strongest increase in employment since 1997. It is difficult to understand why firms should increase employment so significantly if their existing workforce is not fully utilised. Some of this behaviour may be explicable if employment growth were concentrated in sectors of the economy which are expanding most quickly, especially those orientated towards the export sector. But it is striking that this pattern of rising employment and weak productivity is common across most sectors of the It is also possible that firms in some parts of our economy are having to work flat out just to generate the same amount of business. Estate agents, for example, trying to match buyers and sellers in a thin housing market. Or M&A teams pitching for new business. The extra effort that is required may explain why these types of companies do not report much spare capacity. But it does not help to explain why companies facing these types of pressures should want to expand greatly their workforces. It is hard to reconcile the number of new jobs created over the past year with the belief that firms are sitting on a substantial margin of spare capacity.  The recent weakness in productivity may also have been exaggerated by the sheer difficulty of measuring economic activity in real time. We know that early estimates of output are often revised as more comprehensive data become available. Recent productivity may look less disappointing if subsequent estimates of output are marked up. And indeed, based in part on the pattern of past revisions, the MPC does think that the current and recent level of measured output is more likely to be revised up than down But such revisions are likely to provide only a partial explanation of the productivity puzzle. For example, if GDP were to be revised in line with the path the MPC judge most likely, that would account for only around one fifth of the 9% productivity shortfall. If labour hoarding and data revisions provide only a partial explanation of the recent sluggishness of productivity growth, what else might account for it? Difficulty of extrapolating from the past The second explanation is that it might be misleading to extrapolate from previous trends when gauging the extent of the productivity puzzle. The past is not necessarily a good guide to the future. In particular, there are reasons to think that past productivity growth in both the energy extraction sector and the financial services sector may provide a poor guide to more recent trends in underlying growth in those sectors. In the twenty years prior to the financial crisis, productivity in the energy sector grew at an average annual rate of over 3%. But the pace of productivity growth slowed markedly in the past decade or so as North Sea oil fields aged and energy extraction became more difficult. Indeed, since the mid-2000s, productivity has In contrast, productivity growth in the financial services sector increased very sharply in the 10 years prior to the financial crisis, underpinned by the process of financial liberalisation and strong growth in financial sector balance sheets. It does not seem sensible - certainly with the benefit of hindsight - to think that this strong growth would continue indefinitely. Re-estimating the scale of the productivity puzzle using more plausible estimates for trend productivity growth in these two sectors reduces the size of the productivity shortfall by up to 2 percentage points - that is from around 9% to 7% - with the majority of that difference reflecting slower underlying productivity growth within the energy extraction sector.  Extrapolating from the past may also be misleading if some businesses were operating at above normal levels of capacity utilisation prior to the recession. If that were the case, some of the subsequent slowdown in productivity growth would simply reflect the need for companies to adjust to more sustainable operating levels. And that indeed appears to be the case, with business surveys pointing to above average capacity pressures in both the manufacturing and services sector prior to the recession. The implied required adjustment may account for around a further 1% point of the productivity shortfall. Taking account of changes in productivity trends within key sectors of the economy and of the position of the economy prior to the start of the recession may account for around one third of the productivity shortfall. But even if we combine both of these factors with the impact of the likely upward revision to GDP, this still leaves a sizeable productivity puzzle - of around one half of the productivity shortfall - to explain. The third explanation is that underlying productivity growth has been weakened by the impact of the financial crisis. It is notable that this explanation is consistent with evidence from business surveys of spare capacity which suggest that underlying productivity growth in the manufacturing and services sector has essentially stagnated since the start of the recession (Charts 5 and 6). What might account for this flat lining in potential productivity? Impact of financial crisis In an accounting sense, this stalling in productivity growth must be attributable to one of two factors. A slowing in the rate at which companies have added to the physical capital used by each member of their workforce. Or a slowing in the pace of efficiency gains associated with the way in which companies combine capital and labour to produce output, known in the jargon as total factor productivity. In reality, it is unlikely that a slowing in the pace of capital accumulation contributed significantly to the weakness of productivity. This is largely a matter of arithmetic. Annual business investment flows are small relative to the size of the capital stock. So even though business investment fell by around a quarter in the year following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and remains 20% below its pre-crisis level, it is unlikely to have had a significant impact on the stock of capital available per worker.  It is possible that this simple arithmetic underestimates the impact of the falls in investment spending, particularly if the falls were concentrated in highly-productive forms of investment. Perhaps because in the face of the deep recession companies were less willing to undertake riskier, high-return investment projects, and the constraints on UK banks made them less willing to finance them. But even so, this skewing would have to be very marked to have had a material impact on the quality of the capital stock. The capital stock is also likely to have been eroded by increased levels of capital scrapping, as some companies were forced out of business and others scaled back their operations in order to survive. Although increased levels of capital scrapping are likely to have played some role, they seem unlikely to provide the key to the productivity puzzle. In particular, although corporate liquidations have increased in the recession, that increase has been relatively contained and significantly less than we might have feared given the depth of the recession. Rather if the evidence from the business surveys is to be believed, and the growth of productive potential in the manufacturing and services sector has indeed largely stalled in recent years, this is more likely to reflect a slowing in total factor productivity (or TFP for short). I know what some of you might be thinking: this sounds like another one of those unobservable, abstract concepts so beloved by economists, but with little connection to the real world. And you would have a point! But think of it as efficiency gains. The fact that companies, as they hone their working practices and improve their internal processes, are able to increase the amount of output they produce for a given level of labour and capital input. Did the financial crisis and recession dampen the pace of efficiency gains in our economy, at least Recessions are actually often credited with improving average levels of efficiency, as less productive firms are forced out of business and others drive through productivity gains in order to stay afloat. Only the fittest - and the most efficient - survive. But this recession differed to those in our recent experience since it was triggered by a financial crisis. Banks' ability to lend was reduced. Credit conditions tightened. The implications of this for the efficiency with which companies operate are potentially far reaching. Many smaller companies and new businesses, which are a critical source of innovation in our economy, have struggled to secure the finance they need to grow and expand. Company start-ups fell sharply during the recession, and evidence from the Bank's Agents suggests that many smaller businesses are still struggling to access funds at affordable rates. In that context, it is worth recalling that small companies,  employing less than 100 employees, hold over 40% of UK patents, even though they account for less than 20% of total investment. Even for those companies that are able to borrow funds, the tightening in credit conditions is likely to have impeded the efficiency of supply. Some companies have become more cautious, preferring to hang onto liquidity or pay down debt rather than invest in increased levels of training and R&D. The increased cost of working capital has led many firms to cut back substantially on their inventory levels, disrupting the efficiency of supply chains. More generally, the amount of management time devoted to raising finance and managing banking relationships has increased very substantially, diverting attention from the search for new products and new markets. It is impossible to quantify with any precision the effect that strains within the banking system have had on the growth of productivity over the past few years. But evidence from previous periods of financial turmoil suggests that the effect might be material. In particular, research by the IMF suggests that persistent falls in TFP growth following banking crises can account on average for around one third of the loss of output seen So where does all this leave us? As I warned you upfront, I don't think there is a single, simple explanation for the recent surprising weakness of productivity. Some of it may well get revised away. And some of it may be because our sights were set too high based on past trends. But I also think there are good reasons to think that the recession, and particularly the impact of the financial crisis, may have dampened underlying productivity growth in recent years. At the risk of stating the bleeding obvious, we need the banks to be working for our economy to grow and prosper. Productivity and monetary policy Why does all this matter for monetary policy? The medium-term outlook for inflation depends critically on the balance of demand and supply in the economy. If demand is greater than the goods and services that can be supplied, prices will tend to rise. And vice versa. As such, when setting monetary policy, the MPC needs to make an assessment about current and future trends in supply, as well as demand.  The discussions about economic growth we typically read about in newspapers and see on TV are normally posed in terms of demand. Is gloom on the high street spreading? Claims and counter-claims about the likely impact of the fiscal consolidation. But the MPC also needs to consider the prospects for supply. How quickly is the capital stock likely to grow? And, importantly, will the recent weakness in productivity persist or Typically, the growth rates of factors determining the supply potential of our economy - population, the capital stock, structural productivity- are far less volatile than those of demand. As such, it is often natural for the main focus of policy to be concentrated on the prospects for demand. But judgements about supply also matter, particularly so in the aftermath of a deep recession. In recessions, demand typically falls by more than supply. An output gap opens up - the economy can supply more than is currently demanded. And unless that gap is closed, it will push down on costs and prices. The job of monetary policymakers is to loosen policy, so that demand is brought back into balance with supply and inflation remains close to target. Exactly how expansionary policy should be depends critically on the size of the output gap. But assessing the size of the output gap is very difficult, for exactly the reasons we have been discussing today. Early estimates of economic activity can be revised substantially, so it is hard to know just how weak demand and output really are. And it is equally difficult to know the extent to which the supply potential of the economy has been affected by the recession. This difficultly greatly complicates the setting of monetary policy. Indeed, in a series of influential papers, Athanasios Orphanides (eg Orphanides 2003) has argued that over-estimates of the size of the output gap played an important role in the policy mistakes that led to the period of persistently high inflation in the US in the 1970s and 80s. I hope that we are learning some of the lessons from the past. Taken at face value, the depth of the recession might suggest there is considerable spare capacity within our economy. And indeed there is considerable slack within the labour market - unemployment has risen by almost 900,000 since the start of the recession - and this has acted to contain wage pressures. But the degree of slack within firms is probably significantly less than implied by the shortfall in productivity for all the reasons I've just explained. An assessment of the output gap requires an evaluation of the current level of supply. But the MPC also needs to form a view about the pace at which the supply capacity of the economy is growing. When faced with a period of weak output growth, it is tempting to conclude the policy should be eased in order to boost the pace of growth and so stop the output gap widening further. And that may well be the right policy prescription. But just how much demand should be boosted depends on the extent to which the weak demand growth is matched by sluggish growth in potential supply.  If indeed underlying productivity growth in our economy has been weak in the recent past - perhaps due to the lingering effects of the financial crisis - this may well continue for a while yet. To be clear, this is not the same as saying that the growth rate of the supply potential of our economy has been permanently scarred by the financial crisis. But rather over the next two or three years - which is the horizon which matters for monetary policy - we shouldn't automatically assume that underlying productivity will necessary grow at the sorts of rates to which we have become accustomed to in the past. Policymakers need to think about supply as well as demand when responding to weak output growth. Let me conclude with some brief comments about the current policy outlook. You may know that between February and August of this year, I was one of the members of the MPC that had been voting to raise Bank Rate. As I mentioned at the time, my vote was not based on the nice reasons that the economic recovery looked firmly entrenched and the exceptional monetary easing implemented at the height of the crisis was no longer required. Rather, it was driven by nasty reasons. I wasn't confident about the strength of the recovery and I was worried about the downside risks to growth. But I was even more worried about the outlook for inflation. In particular, the risks from continuing global price pressures, and the risk that the prolonged period of high inflation would affect the credibility of monetary policy. And as I've just discussed, the growing belief that the degree of spare capacity in our economy was probably less than might appear at first sight. But I also suggested that policymakers should approach their task with considerable pragmatism, and that if some of the downside risks to growth materialised, I'd reverse my vote. And that indeed is what has happened. The outlook for demand over the past few months has weakened quite materially. Consequently, at the August MPC meeting, I reversed my position and voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5% and the stock of asset purchases at PS200 billion. And as shown in the minutes published this morning, I voted the same way at this month's MPC meeting. So what has happened to our economy over the past few months? The deterioration in the outlook largely reflects developments outside of our shores. Growth in the world economy, including in our core trading partners in Europe and the US, has slowed. Concerns about the fiscal positions of some countries, particularly within the euro area, have intensified. This in turn has fuelled worries and uncertainties about the resilience of the international banking system. And perhaps most fundamentally of all, confidence that the authorities have the ability to respond to these challenges in a  decisive and timely manner has diminished. These four factors have fed on each other, leading to a pronounced downward spiral. The UK has been caught in the fallout from these external developments. The strong growth in our exports seen through much of the past year has faltered, with knock on implications for the growth of manufacturing output. Renewed turmoil within financial markets has led to a sharp reduction in asset prices and to increased funding pressures on our banks. And confidence, both within companies and households, has taken another downward step. The role of monetary policy in such circumstances is to support demand, so as to help bring inflation back to target in the medium term. And that is exactly what the MPC is doing. Interest rates remain at exceptionally low levels. The programme of quantitative easing undertaken last year continues to provide significant stimulus to demand. It is also noteworthy that market interest rates two and three years ahead have declined markedly over the past couple of months, leading a material easing in monetary conditions. If the economic situation continues to deteriorate, some additional loosening in monetary policy might be needed. But that decision will need to be weighed against the backdrop of continuing high inflation, with inflation set to climb higher over the next few months. And, as I've emphasised today, it will also need to take account of the extent to which the slowing in output reflects weak growth in supply as well as demand.

5592,2014-04,"I delivered a speech entitled ""The UK economy: the road ahead?"" where I envisioned a moderate pickup in growth through 2013 and into 2014. I am pleased to say today that, as a policymaker behind the steering wheel, that road has felt more like a highway than a country lane. The UK economy has forged ahead over the past year, exceeding my then relatively upbeat expectations. The recovery - after a prolonged period of stagnation - has been striking. GDP has grown on average by 0.8% per quarter since the start of last year and almost half a million jobs have been created over that period, pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.9% in February. Inflation has declined and stood at 1.6% in March, the lowest level in more than four years and below our 2% target. But these are still early days. Despite continued buoyant growth - indeed GDP grew by 0.8% in the first quarter of this year according to this morning's release, the current level of activity is still just shy of its pre-crisis peak, more than five years after the onset of the Great Recession. And some questions remain about quite how sustainable the recovery will prove to be. So far it has been driven largely by private consumer spending - as is typical in the early stages of cyclical upturns - but that has reflected a decline in the private saving rate, which can only have so much further to go. The recovery in business investment, still in its infancy, will need to become more entrenched on the back of stronger demand, both domestic and foreign. And it would be nice to see a more sustained revival in net exports. It was to help sustain and secure the recovery that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) introduced explicit forward guidance about monetary policy last August, committing not to raise Bank Rate until we saw a period of sustained growth, rising incomes and employment - so long as there was no threat to either price or financial stability. The goal was two-fold: to prevent a premature tightening at the short end of the yield curve and to boost confidence by providing reassurance to households and businesses that they should not fear imminent increases in interest rates. Forward guidance sets out how policy will react to future economic developments, rather than setting any predetermined calendar. In particular, it sets out how we will respond, as the economy recovers, to the gradual erosion in the degree of slack - the balance between supply and demand, which is an important determinant of the degree of inflationary pressure in the economy. The state-contingent nature of our guidance is inevitable because, for all the effort put into our economic forecasts, the exact evolution of the economy remains uncertain. So the future path of interest rates will depend critically on how the economy evolves, not a predetermined amount of time elapsing. But while the economic outlook itself remains uncertain, we can provide guidance on our ""reaction function"" - how we will respond to the unfolding recovery - to those changes in economic slack and their associated effects on inflation, which is of course the variable we are ultimately responsible for.  So today I would like to share my thoughts on the nexus between slack, pricing pressures and what that means for policy. I will argue that while quantitative estimates of the amount of slack are a useful guide to the direction of travel of spare capacity in the economy, the high degree of uncertainty associated with these estimates also necessitates close and direct monitoring of the pricing pressures they give rise to. As we steer the economy back towards full-capacity operation, it is crucial we watch out for incipient upward pressures in price- and wage-setting behaviour. I believe that the specific pricing signals associated with diminishing slack provide critical signposts for policymakers. Measuring economic slack - the pitfalls of spurious accuracy Economists think of slack as the level of spare, or 'underutilised', capacity, arising either within companies or in the labour market. Let me deal briefly with spare capacity within firms first. As I argued in a recent speech, business surveys suggest that companies are now operating at close to ""normal"" levels of capacity utilisation (shown by the position of the swathe relative to the zero line in ). Analysis of answering practices to such surveys indicates that there is a subtle difference between ""normal"" utilisation and absolutely full capacity, suggesting that a modest increase in demand could still be accommodated within existing fixed capacity, without causing material upward pressure on inflation. It is also the case that a pickup in business investment, which according to recent business surveys is likely to gain pace in coming quarters, will help expand the level of available capacity. That said, there will come a point at which the more intensive utilisation of capital and labour is likely to incur higher costs, putting pressure on companies to increase wages and/or output prices. I will return to these pricing pressures in a moment. Spare capacity in the labour market is a more complex concept because it can take several forms. When we introduced the first phase of forward guidance last summer, pledging not to raise Bank Rate until unemployment fell to at least 7%, our choice of the unemployment rate as a measure of slack was dictated not just by practical concerns (unemployment is widely reported, does not get revised and is well understood by the public), but by the need to work around the large uncertainties that surround estimates of the economy's productive potential. Using the unemployment rate as our gauge of economic slack has meant that we have not had to take strong views on the 'productivity puzzle' - why productivity has remained weak as activity has recovered - making policy robust to supply-side uncertainties. These uncertainties remain and it is not clear to me that the sizeable fall in unemployment since last summer has yet taught us any definitive lessons about whether the weakness of productivity is likely to be permanent or not, and therefore how much spare capacity remains in the economy. Yet assessing that amount of slack,  the pace at which it is being eroded and the attendant effect on inflationary pressures is central to the conduct of monetary policy. That is why, in the second phase of forward guidance that came into effect this month as the unemployment rate passed 7%, the MPC expanded the range of indicators of labour market slack that we are formally monitoring. Rather than focussing on the level of unemployment and trying to assess what is happening to productivity, we are studying closely a broader range of indicators, such as the number of people entering the labour force and the number of hours people work on average. The idea is that in addition to the pool of unemployed workers able to compete for jobs, there are also pools of potential workers that might start looking for a job, as well as underemployed workers - people who are working fewer hours than they desire e.g. part-timers wishing to work full time. They too represent a form of spare capacity, helping control pay pressures as demand recovers. To gauge the degree of inflationary pressure coming from the labour market, these measures are assessed in relation to how far they depart from estimates of their 'normal' or 'equilibrium' levels, that is, how far unemployment is above its medium-term equilibrium level or how much average hours worked are below 'desired' hours. At present, these indicators suggest that the current level of slack in the economy, as reported in the , is in the region of 1-1 1/2 % of GDP, suggesting that there remains some room for demand to recover further without exerting upward pressure on inflation. However, we need to recognise that there is a great deal of uncertainty around the exact level of each of the quantitative indicators of labour market slack that combine to give our estimate of available slack. equilibrium estimates against which current readings are compared are not directly observable. They are based on informed assumptions, for example about how likely the long-term unemployed are to find work again, or the extent to which the reported rise in 'desired' hours is a good proxy for the number of hours people would like to work after adjusting for cyclical factors such as the squeeze on take-home pay. And in some cases they are currently at odds with more qualitative intelligence - the Bank of England Agents' reports of recruitment difficulty and skills shortages already point to tightening in some parts of the labour market. It is also the case that the February estimate of the level of slack - the 1-1 1/2 % of GDP - is a central estimate, not in any sense a statistical confidence range in the manner of the fancharts we publish on inflation and growth. If we were to take a one standard deviation range of each of the components of labour market slack, and sum the lower and upper estimates of each, we would reach a range estimate for the level  of slack of between nought and 2.5%. That is quite a wide range, and although quarterly changes in our central estimate provide a direction of travel, it leaves a good deal of uncertainty about the exact level . Moreover, even if we were able to estimate the exact level of slack with greater precision, it is still is not entirely clear, given the frictions and inflexibilities in the labour market, at what level of slack we should expect in practice to see early inflationary pressures emerging. Pricing pressures to watch For this reason, I believe it is equally important to look directly at the indicators that might give us early signs of emerging inflationary pressures in domestic wage- and price-setting. Broadly, these fall into three categories, which I will be monitoring closely, as this is where the erosion of slack is likely to show up first: Wage bid and wage settlement activity Firms' pricing behaviour and movements in profit margins Signs of firming prices early in the supply chain, such as advertising, transport and distribution Wage negotiations and settlements Monitoring pay pressures is particularly important at the moment. Roughly 70% of annual pay settlements take place in the period January to May, and the evidence suggests that the settlements reached in January set the tone for the rest of the year ( So the pickup in January settlements reported by a number of data providers certainly suggests that nominal pay is finally on the rise. As activity recovers and new business expands, companies do not just increase the remuneration of their existing employees in order to retain them, they also increase the pay of new recruits, to attract the best prospective employees. In fact, such measures of marginal pay, as captured by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC)'s survey, have been a reasonably good leading indicator of average pay growth over the past 15 years ( ). Taken at face value, the sharp pickup in the proportion of REC survey respondents reporting higher salaries for permanent new recruits suggests that broader nominal pay is on the cusp of a strong recovery. An important question is how such increases in labour costs will affect companies' pricing decisions. Companies' labour costs do not just depend on wages, but also on how productive employees are. As such, pay pressures must be considered alongside movements in productivity - the inflationary implications of a pickup in pay growth will be mitigated by a recovery in productivity. Combining this morning's GDP release with data on nominal private-sector pay and employment when they are released will give us an indication of the degree of pressure on unit labour costs - labour costs per unit of output (  Output prices and profit margins Companies' pricing behaviour, in particular how they adjust their output prices to changes in input prices, is also a key metric to watch. When input costs fluctuate, companies have a choice. They can either pass on all of the change or absorb some of it. In the case of weakening costs (e.g. through falling commodity prices), they can thus preserve or rebuild their margins by not reducing output prices fully. Crude measures of margins implied by the difference between input and output prices in manufacturing have picked up in some sectors since the turn of the year, reflecting reduced input prices not fully passed through, as can be seen in . Early supply chain prices Finally, as recovery takes hold, companies also spend more on services that help them win new business, such as advertising, pushing up the price of advertising services. In addition, those services that underpin the wide range of activities across the economy, such as transport and distribution, are early indicators of diminishing slack, and rising price pressures. So specific pricing behaviour in these sectors can also be a good early indicator of a tightening economy. At present, these indicators, by and large, are still showing little sign of upward price pressure ( but will need to be monitored closely as the upswing unfolds. So, at this stage of the recovery, it appears that the early supply chain pricing environment remains benign. But turning points are hard to predict and can be quite abrupt, and, in light of the revival in pay - which after all makes up companies' main input cost - we must not be complacent. As demand recovers and slack is eroded, price pressures might pick up relatively quickly, a fact we must be alert to. Implications for policy Keeping a close eye on such early stage price and pay pressures (as well as their relationship to changes in productivity) should give us greater precision as to the timing of necessary increases in interest rates, as it reduces the degree of uncertainty inherent in many of the quantitative estimates of slack. This will allow us to help support the recovery, without risking an acceleration in underlying price pressures and thus an overshoot of the target in the medium term. The evolution of these early indicators of pricing pressures, as well as the quantitative estimates of slack and our interpretation of them will therefore guide the timing of the first rise in Bank Rate. I am sure that as the recovery develops, we will see some lively debate within the Committee as to the implications, but so far there has been general agreement that there is room for further slack to be absorbed as the recovery progresses, implying that there is no need for an immediate rise in Bank Rate.  But there are additional considerations when deciding the optimal path for Bank Rate to support the recovery, close the effective output gap and deliver our inflation target. We need to consider not only the ""lift-off"" point - the timing of the first rise in Bank Rate - but also the pace of tightening thereafter, as well as the likely ""neutral"" rate in 2-3 years' time (the rate that will at that point be consistent with inflation at target and output at trend). That is why the new guidance that we outlined in February, on how monetary policy would be conducted after unemployment reached our 7% threshold, gave indications on these elements too. In essence, the second phase of our guidance states, subject to inflation remaining under control, that the current level of slack is such that we see no reason for an immediate rise in Bank Rate; once Bank Rate does start to rise, changes are likely to be gradual . This reflects an environment where the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is perhaps more uncertain than usual, and in which households and businesses may be more than normally sensitive to the initial changes in interest rates; and the ""neutral"" rate in 2-3 years' time is likely to be materially lower than the 5% level that prevailed before the crisis (reflecting the ongoing headwinds from balance sheet adjustment, elevated credit spreads, fiscal restraint and subdued foreign demand that will still be weighing on the economy). To my mind, these three elements of policy normalisation - the timing of the first rise, the pace of tightening thereafter, and the longer term equilibrium level of Bank Rate - are inextricably linked, and there are potential trade-offs between them. To the extent that the endpoint of our normalisation journey - the level of the 'neutral' rate - is materially lower than before the crisis, we clearly have less far to travel, which might make the first rate rise appear less pressing than if we had to return to a neutral rate of 5%. On the other hand, a gradual trajectory for rates can be ensured only if the first rate rise is not held back, such that we start the normalisation process before the economy reaches effective capacity constraints, so that inflation expectations and pressures are kept well in check. So where does that leave us? The exact path of Bank Rate over the next few years will depend on how the economy develops, a path that still contains a high level of uncertainty and some critical risks. I - and my colleagues - will not compromise our primary objective of hitting the 2% inflation target; if inflationary pressures were to pick up sharply, we would need to react. But, in setting policy over the coming period, we also aim to deliver a recovery that is fully self-sustaining and robust to a normalisation of policy after an extended period of record low rates. Looking at the economy today, I am encouraged by the progress that has been made over the past year, and believe that the chances of a fully sustained recovery are now the highest they have been for some time. The long period of persistent above-target inflation came to an end at the turn of the year, and the outlook for  inflation looks more benign than for some time. But if I have learned one thing in economics, it is that we can never be complacent, and that we on the MPC still face challenges in ensuring that the improvement in the outlook for both inflation and growth is maintained.

5479,2012-05,"All speeches are available online at In the first quarter of this year, the level of GDP in the UK was about 4% lower than it was just before the banking crisis which came in the second half of 2008. A wide gap has emerged between GDP and where it might have been in the absence of the crisis: had growth followed its pre-crisis trend of a bit above 2.5% per year, GDP now would have been about 10% higher than in 2008, and not 4% lower. The size of that gap is GDP, and how GDP might have evolved in the absence of the banking crisis This is considerably larger than the gap that had opened in the UK four years into the Depression of the 1930s. Unless growth picks up very sharply to well above trend over the next couple of years the size of the output gap - at least based on this sort of fairly crude trend-fitting - will become even larger relative to the other recessions of modern history (see Figure 2). But how much of that apparently huge gap actually reflects a fall in the amount the UK could produce rather than a chasm between actual production and the economy's potential output? That question is central to monetary policy. Potential output is also directly relevant to the welfare of the country - it is the income it can earn without resources being under-utilised or squeezed too hard. By ""squeezed too hard"" I mean that if output exceeds potential there will be triggered some adjustments - e.g. workers might require higher wages to continue providing a higher level of hours which might for a short while be provided at unchanged rates of pay. If actual output nears potential output, inflationary pressures generated domestically are likely to rise. But when a wide gap exists between potential and actual output, inflation pressures will tend to be weak. All speeches are available online at While a number of other factors affect inflation, the distance between potential and actual output, sometimes referred to as slack, is a crucial determinant of inflation. Evolution of GDP from the start of the 2008 and previous recessions relative to the respective trends Estimating potential output is therefore key for monetary policy makers. But it is also difficult. And that difficulty is acute when, as now, the economy has been buffeted by huge shocks that have taken it a long way from what seemed to be its steady trajectory. One indication of this difficulty is that different measures of slack in the UK are now giving very different signals about the level of potential output. Weak GDP growth and fairly stubborn inflation, along with evidence from surveys of firms, suggest that the amount of slack is considerably smaller than the more than 10% gap between the level of GDP and its pre-crisis trend. That evidence should make one doubt estimates from simple extrapolation of past trends; there is likely to be less slack than simply focusing on GDP relative to trend suggests. But while the amount of slack is probably lower than just fitting trend lines to past activity suggests, it is not likely that renewed growth in GDP would immediately create substantial inflationary pressures. That is not just because slack is still likely to be substantial today; it also reflects the likelihood that effective capacity is itself likely to expand All speeches are available online at with demand and activity. Just as weak growth in GDP drags down potential output, strong growth tends to increase it. This considerably complicates the task for monetary policy: inflation, output, and potential output are interdependent, and all three are affected by monetary policy. I want to explore this interdependence in more detail, and consider what it implies for how monetary policy should be set now. I'll first discuss how potential output may have evolved since the crisis started, and how it might evolve in the future under different assumptions for GDP growth. I'll then turn to what that means for monetary policy. I want to explain why there is a case for making monetary policy more expansionary, even when inflation has surprised us repeatedly on the upside. Labour productivity and labour supply One way to estimate potential output is to decompose it into two factors, labour supply and labour productivity. Labour productivity measures what a given amount of labour can produce on average. Multiplying this by the supply of labour yields potential output. Labour productivity Figure 3 shows the level of labour productivity, measured as GDP over total hours worked, together with a simple estimate of its trend since 1971. All speeches are available online at Labour productivity and an estimate of its pre-crisis trend The trend - which is assumed to be linear in the log of labour productivity - describes the long-run evolution of labour productivity reasonably well; but only up to the start of the banking crisis. Since then, productivity If labour productivity had followed its pre-crisis trend, it would now be about 10% higher. This is almost as much as GDP has fallen behind its pre-crisis trend. But it seems unlikely that underlying labour productivity, and with it potential GDP, has declined permanently by almost as much as actual GDP. Labour productivity in the past has shown considerable cyclical - by definition non-permanent - variability. A simple statistical (time-series) model of labour productivity suggests that in the past about 10% of the gap between labour productivity and its trend is closed in each quarter (see Annex A1 for details). This suggests that when productivity departs from its trend, almost 60% of the gap to trend is typically closed after two years . All speeches are available online at Deviation of labour productivity from its pre-crisis trend On the basis of these results, we should expect labour productivity growth to pick up strongly and very soon. Indeed, on this view it is puzzling why it has not done so already. One answer is that we had not experienced a banking crisis of similar severity during the past forty years, the period over which the typical catch up of labour productivity to its smooth trend has been estimated. A related reason is that GDP has not yet recovered: labour productivity growth and GDP growth are strongly positively correlated. It is very hard to untangle the causal mechanisms at work behind the correlation between GDP growth and the growth in labour productivity - is labour productivity very weak because GDP growth has been very weak, or is weak labour productivity the cause of weak GDP? One way to try to figure out what is going is by estimating vector autoregressions - that is time series models that allow for the interdependence between GDP and productivity. I have used that type of model to explore the relationship between GDP and labour productivity (see Annex A1). The model suggests that GDP growth will affect the path for labour productivity. The red line in Figure 5 shows the evolution of labour productivity that the regressions predicts if GDP growth from now to 2015 was zero. Because labour productivity has a tendency to close the gap between its current level and its trend, this gap tends to close even when GDP growth is zero. By the end of 2015, the shortfall - currently about 10% - would have declined to about 4.5% of the estimated trend for labour All speeches are available online at productivity. But the adjustment would be considerably faster if annual GDP growth was positive. The blue line illustrates this under the assumption that annual GDP growth was 3% for the next three years. Here, the gap would have declined to about 1.5% by the end of 2015. Estimated evolution of labour productivity for different scenarios for GDP growth This simple exercise suggests that while labour productivity is likely to pick up over time, even if GDP growth remains weak, faster GDP growth is likely to increase the speed of the recovery of labour productivity. If these results are a guide to where we are now in the UK it has implications for inflation and for monetary policy . Stronger labour productivity would pull down unit labour costs unless it is fully matched by higher wages. This means that stimulating GDP growth with monetary policy does not have to lead to strong inflationary pressures . How reliable is this evidence? There are certainly plausible reasons why measured labour productivity may be temporarily depressed in a recession and those go beyond the apparent empirical regularity that periods when labour productivity seems to fall far below trend are followed by productivity bouncing back towards trend. It is not simply a case of blindly believing past correlation for which there is little plausible interpretation based on business behaviour. The costs of closing and re-opening capacity can be high. Rather than firing staff immediately, firms may accept that their employees work less efficiently in a downturn. For example, keeping a shop open may require the presence of a minimum number of cashiers and shop assistants, even if they serve fewer customers. But when business picks up the productivity of those staff rises fast. All speeches are available online at But all the quantitative results described above are based on historical correlations. They only inform us about the future if we assume that the current recession is structurally similar to previous ones, even though it is larger. But the structure of this recession is different: it was triggered by what was probably the largest banking crisis in the UK's history. The results therefore have to be treated with care. Labour supply If labour supply were to be much lower because of the crisis then even if labour productivity recovers completely the hit to productive capacity could still be very large. That would mean that effective slack in the economy could be very much lower than the time series evidence on productivity seems to suggest. Employment has fallen since the start of the crisis, and long-term unemployment has picked up (Figure 6). The rise in the jobless is much less than would have been expected based on the fall in output - which is another way of posing the puzzle of the collapse in productivity relative to past trends. And indeed jobs in the private sector have increased fairly substantially over the past year - which is one sign that spare capacity may be less than the trend lines described above suggest. Nonetheless long term unemployment may increase further if short-term unemployed are not able to join the labour market soon. The increase in long-term unemployment means that there is a risk that a part of the labour force has lost skills, and may struggle to find employment even when growth picks up. In some sense the effective labour supply has shrunk. But other factors work in the opposite direction. There is a large pool of short-term unemployed, most of whom are likely to be willing to work at existing wages if they were able to find a job, and many of whom may be more willing to work as a result of being unemployed. Stronger net immigration might also help to contain wage growth once prospects improve here. All speeches are available online at Unemployment and long-term unemployment rates And there are other factors which are likely to lead to more labour supply. The hit to wealth that many households have felt means that people with a target level of savings (for example to finance retirement spending) may both aim to work longer and possibly consume less. Currently both real share prices and real house prices are about a quarter below their pre-recession peaks (Figures 7 and 8). The factors that increase labour supply offset - and maybe more than offset - the negative impact of higher actual unemployment upon future effective labour supply. All speeches are available online at UK equity prices - FTSE All-share index adjusted for inflation UK house prices adjusted for inflation Looking at the overall forces that are affecting labour supply and labour productivity I think it is plausible that potential output may have fallen in the aftermath of the crisis, but not to the same extent as GDP. The decline in labour productivity could reverse quickly when GDP growth picks up, and any additional demand for labour could probably be satisfied without substantial increases in wages. In short, there is probably substantial slack. Yet some people believe that spare capacity is, despite the big falls in GDP and low growth of recent years, very small. Surveys of spare capacity, and the path of inflation itself, lend some weight to that. But how should we interpret the survey evidence and what light does CPI inflation throw on spare capacity within the UK? All speeches are available online at But those firms may still be able to expand production very substantially within the longer time frame of several quarters over which monetary policy typically affects the economy. And many firms might see their staff busy trying to do business and win contracts but with less success than in more normal economic times. Estate agents, advertising executives and car salesmen may have to work more now on the average sale. That shows up as poor productivity and would not typically show up as spare capacity in a survey. But if demand were stronger the productivity of those workers would improve. This phenomenon may be more relevant in services than in manufacturing - though even within manufacturing firms there will be people working on sales and marketing. Finally, the survey results are difficult to translate into quantitative estimates of spare capacity. The reason is that the survey questions usually only generate qualitative responses: firms typically indicate whether output is below capacity or not. The aggregate responses only tell us how many more firms work below capacity than at or above capacity. So a zero balance could be the result of half of all respondent working just below capacity whereas the other half operates considerably above capacity. Or, a zero balance could occur when half of all respondent work considerably below capacity, whereas the other half work just above capacity. Clearly, there is much more spare capacity in the second case; but that will not show up in the survey balances. Persistent inflation Besides survey responses there is another, less direct, bit of evidence that seems to support the view that there is much less spare capacity in the UK than the deviation in GDP or in labour productivity from trend suggests: inflation has not fallen back as quickly as many people - including the Monetary Policy Committee - forecast. Spare capacity is likely to affect what one might call domestically generated inflation pressures; cost pressures arising from outside the UK are not at all likely to be affected by slack within the UK economy (though the extent to which they are passed on into domestic prices might be). The main reason why inflation over the past few years has fairly consistently been above the forecasts made by the MPC is that externally generated cost pressures turned out higher than had seemed most likely: sharp increases in energy prices, rising import prices, in part due to the depreciation of sterling, and the increase in VAT all played a role. Domestically generated inflationary pressures are likely to have been much lower, and may even have been negative, dragging down headline inflation (Figure 10). Yet those forces restraining inflation have been drowned by the forces driving up inflation. Why has the impact of slack not been greater? One factor that could explain why slack has not held inflation lower is that impairment to credit makes it harder for some firms to respond to spare capacity by cutting prices (or raising them less than costs) to gain All speeches are available online at market share. Take a firm with spare capacity that considers reducing the prices of its products, attempting to attract a competitor's clients. If the firm reduces its prices, initially its revenue and profit are likely to fall: its existing customers take advantage of the price reduction while the firm is still waiting for new clients to arrive. When bank credit is ample, the firm may be willing and able to accept a likely initial decline in revenue and profits which is compensated for by higher revenues later. That strategy may not be feasible when bank funding is harder to get. : Measures of domestically generated inflation Let me summarise these thoughts on the evidence of the degree of spare capacity and on the impact of a given degree of spare capacity upon inflation pressures. First, both the degree of slack and the impact slack has on inflation are not possible to measure directly - we have to rely on indirect evidence. Second, one powerful set of indirect measures - the path of GDP and of labour productivity relative to trend - suggest there is lots of spare capacity. But, third, surveys suggest slack may not be so large. Fourth, while the inflation evidence is to a significant extent a reflection of cost pressures not really affected by UK spare capacity, I think it does suggest that the degree of slack may be having less of an impact than usual, a phenomenon that could be linked to the disruption to credit. What to make of all this? My own (Bayesian) view is that rather than interpret the recent slightly greater inertia in inflation as simply reflecting much less slack in the economy I would ascribe a significant part to a All speeches are available online at smaller downward impact of a given amount of slack on inflation pressures. It might look like splitting hairs to apportion more of an explanation to a weaker impact of spare capacity and less to an erosion of capacity. But I think this makes a difference to monetary policy. If spare capacity does have a weaker impact on domestically generated inflation pressures it changes the costs and benefits of bringing inflation back to target faster or slower. In the next section I want to consider this in more detail. Policy implications To draw out the policy implications of changing assessments of the degree of spare capacity and of its impact on inflation let me use a simple graph (Figure 11), whose shape is familiar to all economists. This graph shows a relation between a measure of inflation pressures (on the vertical axis) and a measure of slack. In its original form, as developed by Phillips, the measure of slack was unemployment. In my version (and in many current economic models) slack is the output gap - here defined as the difference between potential output and actual output. The relation between an amount of slack and a degree of inflation pressures is reflected in the curves in the diagram - let me call these (abusing slightly his original meaning) Phillips curves. : Stylised Phillips curves and output gaps Assume that one initially believed that the relationship between slack in the economy - that is potential output minus actual output - and domestically generated inflation is described by the red curve in Figure 11 (labelled P0). One would then believe that a big output gap of x would be associated with very low All speeches are available online at domestically generated inflation of . But suppose our best measure of inflation pressures turned out to be higher than that, say at . This could be rationalised either by assuming that the red curve is correct but that there is substantially less slack (of x ). Or, one might think that the red curve is wrong, and that the relationship between slack and inflation pressure is better described by the flatter, blue curve (P1). In this case, observed inflation pressure of would be consistent with an unchanged assessment of the output gap. Discriminating between these rationalisations of higher than anticipated domestically generated inflation requires judgement, because we can't observe directly either the output gap or the slope of the Phillips curve; and indicators of slack may be giving us conflicting signals. A Bayesian would make some adjustment to the estimate both of slack and the slope of the curve. That is what I have done over the past year or so. I conclude that there is less slack than I would have thought - given the big falls in GDP, weak growth and very poor labour productivity - but that the Phillips curve is also somewhat flatter. This is illustrated by the shift from the red to the green curve (labelled P2), where surprisingly high inflation of is associated with a smaller impact of slack on inflation and also a lower output gap, x . All else equal, monetary policy should be tightened when inflation surprises on the upside and the output gap is estimated to be narrower than thought earlier. But all else is not equal here if the Phillips curve has indeed flattened. A flat curve has two implications that are essentially just two sides of the same coin. On one side, tighter monetary policy will have less of an impact on bringing inflation back to target. A lot of spare capacity is needed to reduce inflation quickly - and a lot of spare capacity means underutilisation of capital and more unemployment, which is costly in terms of welfare. On the other side, stimulating demand will put less pressure on inflation. So the price of bringing above-target inflation back down quickly is high, while the cost of more expansionary policy - which means a slower trajectory of inflation coming back to target - has fallen. As a result, the optimal path of monetary policy is likely to entail a slower return to the inflation target. It may even be optimal to make policy more expansionary even as one's estimate of spare capacity is lowered. I discuss this more formally in Annex A2 within the framework of a standard model of monetary policy. There is another powerful reason for accepting that inflation should return to target gradually if we start from an unhappy position of above target inflation and significant slack, as I believe we do today. The longer output lies below potential, the more likely potential output itself declines - perhaps permanently. Hysteresis means that the assumption of an unchanging path for underlying capacity is a poor one. Workers lose some of their skills during long spells in unemployment. Long-term unemployment has already picked up during the crisis. The pool of qualified labour from which firms can hire then risks shrinking. The more quickly economic activity recovers, the smaller the risk of substantial declines in potential output. All speeches are available online at Accurate assessment of the degree of spare capacity is difficult. There are good arguments for why potential output has fallen significantly since the financial crisis. But there are also reasons for believing that the impact of slack on inflation is lower - the Phillips curve is flatter. Some of the reasons for the decline in demand and activity and the flattening of the Phillips curve have the same source in impaired supply of credit which makes it harder for firms to respond to slack by cutting prices to slowly gain market share. None of this is certain. The existence of substantial slack, of a flatter Phillips curve and of a high degree of dependence of productive potential upon demand (hysteresis) are all uncertain. But I believe they are consistent with the evidence and that they make an exceptionally expansionary monetary policy appropriate. No one on the MPC feels comfortable with the prolonged and substantial overshoot of inflation above its target level. But that does not mean bringing inflation back to target very rapidly is the best thing to do. In a situation where weak demand is likely to be having a negative impact upon productive capacity the cost of having a tighter monetary policy to bring inflation back to target fast will be some long lasting damage to incomes. All speeches are available online at where the long-run relationship between GDP and hours is assumed to be log linear with a trend and a constant. d are the coefficients in the long-run equations. g are the coefficients in the adjustment equations for hours and output on the deviation of from the long-run relation between log GDP and log hours. a are the coefficients of the short-run effects on GDP growth b are the coefficients of the short-run effects on hours growth The difference between the two equations is the growth in labour productivity: Ignoring the short-run parts of the VECM, the difference between the equations for and is given by If we restrict , then we can also interpret the long-run residual as the deviation of labour productivity from its trend, and as the speed of adjustment to this trend. For the VECM specification to be valid, 1. both log GDP and log hours need to have a unit root (i.e., the first difference of log GDP and the first difference of hours need to be stationary). An ADF test (not reported) does not reject the hypothesis that the log levels of these variables have a unit root. 2. In addition, log GDP and log hours need to be cointegrated. A Johansson test for cointegration (not reported) does not reject the hypothesis that they are. The estimation results are in Table 1. All speeches are available online at The difference coefficients on the error correction term is 0.10; this is our estimate of the speed with which labour productivity closes a gap from its long run trajectory. The forecasts for labour productivity 2012-15 are computed by using actual data until 2011Q4, imposing a path for GDP on the model for 2012-15, and allowing hours worked to vary assuming that their behaviour is correctly described by the second equation of the VECM. (That is, we set the residuals to that equation to zero throughout the forecast horizon.) A2: Optimal monetary policy when the estimated Phillips curve and output gap change The idea that the speed with which inflation should be brought back to target thorough setting monetary policy depends upon both size of the output gap and the sensitivity of inflation pressures to the gap can be formalised using results from the literature on optimal monetary policy. Woodford (2004) provide one such formalisation, based on earlier results in Woodford (2003) and Woodford and Giannoni (2003). I briefly describe the model from Woodford (2004) and the optimal monetary policy that it implies. Suppose that prices in the economy are fixed one quarter in advance and that prices are only re-optimized at random intervals (following Calvo's original idea). Between occasions on which prices are optimally set they are just automatically indexed to the aggregate price level. All speeches are available online at With fixed capital and no labour market frictions this generates an aggregate supply relation of the form: p p b p p p is the inflation rate in quarter t is the output gap (output - potential output) is the expectations operator is an exogenous shock to inflation Let the objective of monetary policy be to minimise the weighted sum of all future expected inflation distortions and squared deviations of output from its neutral (or natural) level - that is the square of output gaps ( ). In this particular model where we assume indexation of prices as a default for those prices not optimally re-set the inflation distortions come from changes in the rate of inflation. Let the weight upon output deviations relative to that on inflation distortions be l. The size of the output gap depends on real expenditure which we assume is sensitive to interest rates (or more generally to the setting of monetary policy). It is through influencing the size of the output gap that monetary policy affects the rate of inflation; parameter in equation (1) reflects the power of that effect and it ties down the slope of the Phillips curve. Woodford shows that with these assumptions optimal policy is set such that the following condition holds: p p p can be thought of as the optimal long-run inflation target. This condition says that monetary policy should be set so that inflation should be expected to fall back towards the target rate in a way that depends on the likely size of the output gap next period ( ) multiplied by the ratio of the relative importance of the cost of non-zero output gaps to inflation distortions (l) to the sensitivity of inflation to the output gap ( For illustration let us assume that l= 0.04 and = 0.2. The value of l means that much more weight is placed on inflation distortions than the loss from non-zero output gaps in setting monetary policy. (In Woodford and Gionnani (2003) a value of l= 0.048 is used). The value of k means that the effect of a 5% output gap (a very large amount of slack) would be making the quarterly inflation rate fall by about 1 percentage point (=(0.04/0.2)*5%). This is a rapid rate of fall in inflation since it means the annualised quarterly rate would be falling by 4%. All speeches are available online at Suppose initially we start with inflation significantly above target and we have set policy optimally such that the expected output gap next period is 5% ( ). Given these assumptions the optimality condition implies that monetary policy is being set so that in the following period the likely quarterly inflation rate will be 1 percentage point above the target level. If the long run target for the annual inflation rate were to be 2% then the quarterly target rate, p , would be 0.5% Under the optimal monetary policy, the expected quarterly rate of inflation next period would be 1.5% - an annual rate of 6% inflation. What is happening here is that the output gap is so large that the optimal strategy is not to tighten policy so much as to get inflation quickly back to 2%. Rather we allow the quarterly rate next period to be much higher than the target - knowing that the force of the output gap on inflation will be bringing it down sharply further ahead. Now suppose we are on this optimal policy path and then obtain new information, in one scenario, the new information is only about the output gap; and in another scenario, about the output gap and the impact of the output gap on inflation. How might the monetary policy response be different in each scenario? If we thought the likely size of the output gap was much smaller - in fact halved so that with the same monetary policy setting as before the level of would be -0.025 rather than -0.05 - the optimality condition implies that the expected overshoot of the inflation target also be half the size; that is an previously optimal rate of 6% to 4%, monetary policy would have to be tightened: if we left policy unchanged, expected inflation next period would not be 4%, but above 6% because we have reduced our estimate of the output gap. This makes intuitive sense: with less slack in the economy the forces driving down inflation are weaker and also the loss from having unused capacity is smaller. Both those factors mean that monetary policy should be tighter and the second of them means that we should be willing to accelerate the return of inflation to target. Now consider the second scenario. Here we reduce our estimate of the output gap as above (so that at unchanged policy the estimated size of the output gap next period, simultaneously reduce our estimate of the impact of an output gap on inflation, k. (In terms of Figure 11, we believe that the Phillips curve has flattened (green line), and that the output gap is somewhat lower at x2.) Suppose we sharply cut our estimate of k - reducing it by more than half. At unchanged policy this would mean the right hand side of equation (2) rises, since the proportionate decline in the absolute size of the output gap is more than offset by the increase in the ratio l . That would mean that unchanged monetary policy would need to generate a higher rate of inflation than 6% were it to remain optimal. In other words the combination of less of an output gap - which in itself requires less of an inflation overshoot to the target and a clear tightening in monetary policy - is offset by the extra price that has to be paid in terms of more output losses from bringing inflation down faster. The net result is likely to be that a slower path of returning inflation to target is optimal. And it is possible that the optimal monetary policy is All speeches are available online at looser when there are simultaneous falls in both the estimated size of the output gap and in the likely responsiveness of inflation to that gap. A sufficiently large decline in will always make a loosening of monetary policy optimal, even if the reassessment of the size of comes with a simultaneous decline in the estimated size of the output gap.

5076,2002-01,"It is a very great honour for me - as a graduate from that other place - to have been invited to open officially this splendid new home of Oxford economics. It's a great honour but also a real pleasure. It's a pleasure for two main reasons. The first is that it gives me the opportunity to say a long overdue thank-you to the University - and to the Economics Faculty in particular - for the huge contribution that you have made not just to the study of economics in this country but more specifically to the development of our own professional capacity at the Bank of England for economic analysis and policy-making. Economics has increasingly become the working language of large parts of the Bank. [You only have to come through the front door these days to hear people discussing their co-integration with the model they'd met the night before.] We employ nearly 250 people with some form of economics degree - getting on for half our total staff in the analyst/manager grades - and 10% of them studied in Oxford. In the past 3 years 20% of our first degree economists have come from members are clearly identifiable Oxonians, and another 2 were taught away from So we do owe you a great deal - it means, of course, that people will know where the blame lies if we get things terribly wrong. Now there will be those who complain that the extent of Oxford's connection with the Bank reflects sample selection bias. But the fact is we simply cannot afford bias or discrimination. In today's world if you want the best results you have to go for the best people you can find wherever they come from. That explains why our economists have studied at 55 different universities, indeed why about 50 of our economists are non-British nationals from about 15 foreign countries. And that brings me to the second reason why I'm so pleased to be here - which is, like Oliver Twist, to ask for more! Subsidiarity has its place in a different context. But I would suppose there is a non-zero probability that Oxford economics will benefit significantly over time from the centralisation which created the Economics Department in 1999, and its physical concentration into this new building. It's often said that if you laid all the world's economists end to end they'd never reach a conclusion. I'd rather think that if you put all Oxford's more than 1500 economists together the result will be a profusion - of insights and ideas of research and debate, and hence of talent, from which the global and national economies, Oxford, and we too at the Bank will benefit far into the future. Vice Chancellor, you said a moment ago that economics lies somewhere between a science and an art - and I very much agree. In fact perhaps what I most appreciate in all the people who have been appointed to the MPC since it began life 4 years ago, and the Bank staff who support them, is their ability to inform their art with highly sophisticated science, but nevertheless to remain aware of where the science stops and the art takes over. It is that which makes our work such fun. I am cautiously optimistic - to use the central banker's euphemism for ""totally convinced"" - that both the science and the art of Oxford economics will flourish in its new surroundings, and it gives me enormous pleasure to declare your new building [-and not just its windows] officially open. May God bless her - and all who travail in her.",Positive,Neutral,
5941,2019-04,"John Maynard Keynes resigned as a delegate to the Paris Peace Conference over his concerns about the scale of reparations in what would become the . He returned home to write . In that seminal work, Keynes marvelled that before the war: ""The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth... [or] adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world that fancy or information might recommend."" Such global trade and portfolio management were made possible by new technologies ranging from the telegraph to the first transatlantic cable. Century but of the Twenty First. The second great wave of globalisation is cresting. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is just beginning. And a new economy is emerging driven by immense changes in technology, the reordering of global economic power, and the growing pressures of climate change. A new economy requires a new finance. A new finance to serve the digital economy, a new finance to support the major transitions underway across the globe and a new finance to increase the sector's resilience. A new finance with products that are more cost effective, better tailored, and more inclusive. The UK's FinTech companies are creating this new finance. We have just heard from Charlotte Crosswell of Innovate Finance how the UK FinTech sector leads in talent, drive and investment. But you cannot do it all on your own. Your efforts will be even more effective if you have the right conditions in which to innovate and the level playing fields on which to compete. That's why a new finance demands a new Bank of England.  In this spirit, last year at Mansion House, I announced that Huw van Steenis would lead a review of the future of the UK financial system, including recommendations for how the Bank should respond. In two months, Huw will publish his conclusions and the Bank will announce a number of concrete steps to create an environment for a more resilient, effective and efficient financial system. To preview our general approach I want to highlight some recent measures the Bank has been taking. The Bank's strategy is to enable innovation and empower competition, while ensuring monetary and financial stability. Our levers are the hard and soft infrastructure we control: of the UK payment system. And soft infrastructure, such as our rules, regulations and standards. To illustrate what this means in practice, consider three examples of how the new Bank can provide a platform for private innovation to serve the digital economy, to finance major transitions, and to increase the resilience of the financial system. First, at the heart of the new economy, the very nature of commerce is changing. Last year, one fifth of all sales in the UK were online. Next year, it will be one quarter. The new economy is more inclusive, offering easier routes to market for firms both large and small, and greater access for consumers both near and far. We are entering an age when anyone can produce anything, anywhere and sell everywhere through This new digital economy is placing new demands on finance. Consumers and businesses increasingly expect transactions to be settled in real time, checkout to become an historical anomaly, and payments across borders to be indistinguishable from those across the street. In parallel, big data is opening up new opportunities for more competitive, platform-based finance of SMEs. Search and social media data are supplementing traditional metrics to unlock finance for smaller enterprises whose assets are increasingly intangible. This new finance demands a Bank of England that is as open to new providers as it has been to traditional players.  Here's one way we are changing our hard infrastructure in response. The Bank is in the midst of an ambitious rebuild of RTGS , which processes over PS600 billion of payments every day. Until recently only commercial banks had direct access to it, and alternative payment service providers (or PSPs) had to route through them. That made sense in the old financial world arranged around a series of hubs and spokes but it is increasingly anachronistic in the new, distributed finance that is emerging. So we are now making it easier for a broad set of firms to plug in and compete with more traditional providers. Responding to demands from FinTech providers, the rebuild will provide API access to read and write payment data. In July 2017, we became the first G20 central bank to open up access to our payment services to a new generation of non-bank PSPs. Since then, five have become members and there is a growing pipeline of around twenty firms exploring whether and how to join. Wider access will improve services to UK households and businesses and it will bring financial stability benefits by increasing the proportion of settlement in central bank money, diversifying the number of settlement firms, and driving innovation. My second example of how the Bank is providing a platform for private innovation concerns the financing of the major transitions shaping the new economy such as the rapid rise of emerging economic powers and the evolving response to climate change. The transition to a low carbon economy, in particular, will require enormous re-allocations of capital and massive investments in infrastructure--on some estimates as much as $100 trillion globally over the next decade. Firms that anticipate these developments will be rewarded handsomely; those that fail to adapt will cease to exist. This will have enormous ramifications both the financial system and for financial stability. That's why the Bank is transforming our soft infrastructure. Recognising the need for adequate reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities, four years ago the The TCFD has now led to a step change in the demand and supply of climate reporting. With over $100 trillion in assets now demanding TCFD quality disclosures, a market in transition is now being built.  In parallel, the Bank is overhauling its supervisory approach. Earlier this month we published a Supervisory that together set out our expectations for banks and insurers regarding their governance, risk management, strategic resilience and disclosure of climate-related financial risks. To support the capacity building and the development of best practice, the PRA has just established the to work with firms from across the financial system. The Bank of England is also working with central bank and supervisory colleagues from around the world in the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) to improve climate risk management in the core of the global financial system. Our priorities include the development of a small number of high-level climate scenarios that can be used in future system-wide stress tests. Next month, the PRA will require insurers, as part of market-wide stress tests, to consider how their businesses would be affected in different climate risk scenarios. By adapting our soft infrastructure in these ways, the Bank will help ensure that the financial system is not only resilient to climate-related risks but also can take full advantage of the enormous opportunities in a new low carbon economy. My final example of how the Bank is building a platform for FinTech innovation, considers how general purpose technologies, including advanced analytics such as AI, can increase the resilience of the financial system. As much of life moves online, a trail of data is created. Indeed, more data was created in the past two years than in all the years that came before. And this data is creating enormous opportunities for the new finance to serve customers better and to manage risks more effectively. To those ends, the financial sector is investing heavily in the Cloud, Machine Learning and AI. Banking is already the second biggest global spender on AI systems (after retail) and is expected to invest a further $10bn on AI by 2020. AI-enabled solutions are increasingly important in fraud detection as well as automated threat intelligence and prevention. As some in the audience are exploring, there is also significant potential in credit assessments, wholesale loan underwriting and trading. As my colleague James Proudman recently described, such advanced analytics are also likely to lead to changes to the way the Bank conducts supervision.  The PRA promotes safety and soundness based upon forward-looking, judgement-based supervision, in which we identify the key risks facing firms and set supervisory strategies to mitigate them. As a process, it can be broken down into three simple steps: 1) rule-setting and reporting; 2) analysis and monitoring; and 3) setting and communicating a supervisory strategy to mitigate identified risks. Each of these aspects of supervision is amenable to automation, machine learning or AI to some extent. Consider rule setting and reporting. . It is also somewhat less interesting and infinitely more complex. We are currently using advanced analytics to understand the complexity and interconnectedness of the PRA rulebook, to identify ways to simplify our rules, and to make compliance with them easier for firms. And to explore ways to make reporting more efficient and effective, we are running a Digital Regulatory Reporting pilot, with the FCA, on machine readable reporting requirements that firms' systems could interpret and ultimately automate regulatory data collection. These initiatives are goods in and of themselves, but they also create the potential to unlock the power of AI in order to improve the quality of our supervision. When Keynes marvelled at new possibilities, a decade of wealth creation would follow, but its gains gave rise to imbalances in incomes and in trade. When combined with the disaster ensued. Today, new technologies, the new economy and the new finance have the potential to unlock more sustainable and inclusive growth. Consumers can have greater choice and better-targeted services; small and medium sized businesses can access new credit to grow; banks themselves can become more productive, and the financial system overall can become more resilient. Most fundamentally, unlike in Keynes' time, the gains from new technologies will not be limited to men or captured by denizens of the City.  The new finance must be inclusive, allowing everyone to be better connected, better informed and more empowered. By adapting our hard and soft infrastructure, the Bank of England will help create the conditions for such innovation to flourish to promote the good of all the people of the United Kingdom.",Positive,Neutral,
