5062,"The acts of terrorism this week in the US were both tragic and unexpected. If these events did appear to lead to a significant deterioration in consumer confidence, monetary policy can reasonably be expected to respond. However, in the longer-term, the underlying strengths of the US economy are undiminished. Today, we are here to discuss the longer-term forces that have affected our economies in recent years. A NE is defined to be one where structural changes like a significant fall in the equilibrium rate of unemployment and/or a significant increase in the potential growth rate of the economy might have occurred. These could have been driven by many advances are only one. Such structural changes typically lead to a breakdown of the historical econometric relationships that help inform the setting of monetary policy, which then implies that the actual economy appears to be ""new"" relative to the description of the economy embedded in our models. Since the early 1990s, forecasters have, on average, simultaneously underestimated GDP growth and over-estimated inflation in the US and the UK, which is suggestive of structural changes having occurred. However, since this is not true of the rest of the G5, whether or not you believe there is a NE depends crucially on which country is being discussed. Evidence from the UK suggesting that structural relationships determining wages and prices appeared to break down in the 1990s is presented. In the context of the Bank of why these equations broke down is very important to forming a judgment about where inflation is headed. This is illustrated by showing that alternative treatments of the past price forecast errors of this model could, mechanically, easily yield prospective inflation forecasts ranging between around 1% to around 5%. One possible explanation for the pattern of observed forecast errors in the US and the UK is a fall in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU, hereafter). Others point to non-NE factors like lower import prices. Econometric evidence suggests that the NAIRU fell significantly in both the US and the UK, even after one allows for the beneficial influence of lower import prices. There is no evidence suggesting a comparable fall in the NAIRU in the rest of the G5. Most studies now concur that the US has experienced a significant increase in its underlying rate of productivity growth, and that the production and use of ICT have both contributed to this rise. Some authors have argued that the rise in welfare has probably lagged behind the rise in productivity because the aggregate depreciation rate has risen. They suggest that one should use Net Domestic Product (NDP) rather 1995 acceleration in a measure of welfare (suggested by Professor Weitzman) is even greater than that in official, GDP-based measures of productivity, suggesting that the post-1995 US peformance remains impressive. Among the G5 countries, the US is the only country to have experienced a significant increase in labour productivity growth, even though the contribution to growth from ICT capital has risen elsewhere. This deserves further research. The evidence presented for the UK suggests that one reason conventional price equations have tended to predict out-turns higher than actually materialised is, in part, because of an intensification of product market competition. However, non-NE factors like the higher-than-expected exchange rate have also played a role. A new price equation which allowed for such additional influences has the advantage of there being less need to choose between alternative treatments of past forecast errors, which, as was noted above, can lead to rather large differences in the inflation forecast. In addition, the measure of capacity utilisation embodied in the Bank's model appears in recent years to have suggested rather higher levels of capacity use than would be implied either by survey measures or a measure based on an alternative concept of the capital stock, and might therefore have overstated the degree of inflationary pressure. With internet-related stock prices down very significantly, and a global economic downturn, there is much questioning of the NE. This is in part because some more extreme adherents of the NE made the extravagant claim that recessions were a thing of the past. Yet, historical evidence suggests that very significant volatility in share prices and corporate investment is not unusual around periods of rapid technological change. Given the existing investment overhang, and the vulnerability of equity markets, the global economy probably has a difficult period ahead of it. The tragic events this week obviously increase the near-term risks to the global economy. However, this does not diminish the fact that, consistent with the NE view, some gains have been made in the US and the UK. The acts of terrorism this week in the US were both tragic and unexpected. If these events did appear to lead to a significant deterioration in consumer confidence, monetary policy can reasonably be expected to respond. However, in the longer-term, the underlying strengths of the US economy are undiminished. Today, we are here to discuss the longer-term forces that have affected our economies in recent years. The very significant fall in internet-related stock prices, the global economic slowdown and the fall in corporate investment appear to have led many to assert either that we never had a New Economy (NE, hereafter), or that the NE is now dead. There is however, no generally accepted definition of what one means by the NE. There are those who see the NE as being synonymous with an acceleration in the (2000)). However, I regard that as a rather narrow definition. Indeed, much that might be different about the economy today relates not just to ICT advances, but also to the effects of globalisation, intensifying product market competition, labour market reform, financial market liberalisation and several other factors. I am primarily interested in the possibility that these factors have reduced the equilibrium rate of unemployment and/or increased the potential growth rate of the economy. Typically, such structural changes lead to a breakdown of the historical econometric relationships that are embedded in many of the models that help inform the setting of monetary policy. This then makes the economy appear to be ""new"" or ""different"" relative to the description of the economy that resides in many of our models. What I will not discuss today is the version of the NE hypothesis which asserts that the world has changed so much that one now needs a new kind of economics to analyse it (see, eg Kelly (1998)). I shall therefore discuss today some of the important ways in which some of our economies seem to be operating differently as compared to, say, the seventies and eighties. Although I do not believe some of the more extravagant claims that are made for the NE, my best guess is that enough has changed for it to be material to the setting of monetary policy. Indeed, many of us were driven to looking more carefully at the NE hypothesis because some relationships used for forecasting purposes appeared to break down. In recent years, economists and central bankers alike have devoted much time to investigating the possibility that some of the parameters of the historical economic relationships that we rely on may have shifted. This is because, in some countries, forecasts of inflation, unemployment and GDP growth have been systematically biased. Figure 1 compares the forecasts by Blue Chip panellists for unemployment and inflation in the US as compared to the actual out-turns over the 1993-2000 period. Note that forecasters have, for most of the period, over-predicted the level of the unemployment rate in the US. Nonetheless, they have simultaneously over-predicted inflation until recently. A conventional view holds that if the unemployment rate is lower than expected over a sustained period of time, then this is a sympton of excess demand and so, on average, actual inflation must also be higher than expected. However, the actual inflation out-turn over this period was, on average, lower than the 'consensus' inflation forecast. Table 1 displays more formal evidence on forecast errors for the G5 countries. first two columns report the average forecast error for each country and associated t- statistics based on a simple regression. The final column in Table 1 reports an alternative test, which also considers whether the unit coefficient on the forecast is a valid assumption. Taking the UK first, a similar pattern to the US emerges. On average, the consensus forecast has underestimated GDP growth by as much as 0.5% pa over the period, while simultaneously over-estimating inflation by around the same amount. Moreover, these forecast errors are statistically significant even when one allows for the fact that successive forecasts are not independent of each other. The degree to which the consensus has underestimated GDP growth in the US is even greater (around 1%), with the average degree to which inflation has been over- estimated smaller at around - 1/4 %. - Once we move away from the Anglo-Saxon countries, the consensus forecasts appear to have been more accurate or at least more readily explicable. If anything, forecasters of the Japanese economy have been too optimistic about GDP growth, rather than too pessimistic. Inflation forecasts for Japan have, on average, showed no significant bias. A similar picture emerges for Germany, where average inflation has t-statistic [probability] [probability] Four quarter-ahead forecast errors based on consensus forecast taken from 'Consensus Economics'. The forecasts for output are initially GNP and then GDP is used. For inflation, CPI is used except the UK which is RPI until 1996 Q4 and then RPIX. The forecasts are evaluated against the relevant measure. Using Newey-West standard errors, which are robust to serial correlation. only been over-estimated to a rather modest degree and the average GDP forecasting error has been close to zero. Finally, there is statistically significant evidence that the consensus forecast in France has tended to over-estimate inflation (by around 0.4% pa) since 1993. However, unlike the US and the UK, this over-prediction of inflation has been accompanied by a tendency to simultaneously over-estimate GDP growth as well (though not at a statistically significant level), so that a tendency for growth to come in lower than expected might well explain the tendency for inflation to also surprise on the downside. The evidence on forecasting errors suggests that ""something different"" might have happened to historical economic relationships in the US and the UK in the 1990s, but there is no evidence of this being true for the rest of the G5. This may explain why financial markets and central bankers alike have been more interested in the possibility of a NE in the US and the UK, rather than in continental Europe or Japan. Whether or not you believe there is a NE depends crucially on which country is being discussed. The tendency for economic forecasters in the US and the UK simultaneously to under-predict growth and over-predict inflation is potentially consistent with a breakdown in the structural relationships that underlie our forecasting processes. NE- style hypotheses that could explain such a breakdown include changes in the equilibrium rate of unemployment, the underlying rate of productivity growth, or the degree of competitive pressure. Therefore I turn to an examination of the evidence for a breakdown of ""structural"" relationships next. Purely for illustrative purposes, note that the Medium-Term Macroeconometric Model conventional specification for prices (the GDP deflator) as a function of unit labour costs and capacity utilisation. In recent years, there has been a persistent tendency for prices to come in below what the conventional determinants have predicted - specifically, note the tendency for the residuals to be negative since around 1998 in Figure 2. Further, these residuals are statistically significantly different from zero (a These residuals are also economically significant. Understanding why this particular equation has significantly over-predicted inflation in recent years is very important to forming a judgment about where inflation is headed. For example, if we made no additional adjustments, but just used the price equation mechanically, then, other things being equal, the resulting inflation forecast in the August 2001 round would on the precise judgment made about the treatment of the residuals on this equation, an alternative assumption that the recent average level of the residual since 1997 persists generates an overall inflation forecast as low as around 1%. I do want to emphasise that, of course, the published inflation forecast is not just based on the output of an econometric model, but is based on the judgment of the Committee. The recent persistent overprediction of UK inflation does not appear to be restricted to just the above equation for the GDP deflator in the UK. Other structural relationships also appear to have broken down. It is notable that if one takes the wage equation that is to be found in the MTMM, then there is evidence that it has over-predicted wage growth in recent years (ie since around 1992). A fall in the so-called non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU, hereafter) for labour market related reasons is an example of a structural change which might partially explain the pattern of observed forecast errors in the US or the UK. Of course, an intensification of product marker competition, would also, lower the NAIRU, and I shall discuss this possibility in a later section. Certainly the recent performance of the labour market in the US and UK has been impressive. One striking feature of recent US experience is that, over the period 1992-2000, the rate of price inflation was essentially constant even though unemployment rate first fell below 6% (the then prevailing 'consensus' estimate of the NAIRU), many economists predicted an acceleration in inflation which failed to materialise. UK experience has been quite similar. In 1995, the consensus estimate of the NAIRU was that it was around 6 1/2 - 7% (using the claimant count definition). Yet, unemployment has fallen steadily to the current 3.2% without, as yet, triggering any discernible rise in inflation. Of course, various alternative hypotheses have been advanced in an attempt to explain these facts. In the US, they include:- Temporary factors It is argued that lower import prices (associated with a higher dollar, the Asian crisis etc) and decelerating health insurance costs have played an important role in temporarily depressing inflation, and that the NAIRU is actually higher than the current unemployment rate. A variant of this view argues that the acceleration of productivity growth in the 1990s has not, as yet, been fully reflected in wages because wage aspirations respond slowly to increases in productivity growth. As aspirations catch up, inflation will rise so the fall in unemployment may only be partially sustainable. Permanent Factors One might expect the fall in unemployment to be sustainable if the NAIRU has actually fallen for NE-type reasons. In terms of the labour market, changes in how people look for work (eg temporary help agencies), or differences in the demographic composition of the workforce have been suggested as possible explanations for a fall in the US NAIRU. Turning to the UK, I have previously discussed the far-reaching changes that have occurred in the labour market over the last two decades (see Wadhwani (2000a)), so I will not have much to say on that topic today. Union membership and strike activity are much lower. Imbalances in the pattern of labour demand and supply have diminished significantly. Turning to the unemployment benefits regime, the conventional replacement ratio (ie the ratio of out-of-work benefit to estimated in- work income) has fallen. Further, the New Deal and other measures which have tightened the availability of benefits have also probably been influential. Of course, none of this is to deny that, as in the US, lower import prices have also played a role. Various approaches have been used over time to estimate the NAIRU. approach that has become more popular in recent years is to use Kalman filter techniques to estimate a time-varying NAIRU jointly with a Phillips curve. Staiger, Stock and Watson (2001) argue that their Kalman filter based estimate of the time- varying NAIRU in a price-based Phillips curve for the US fell by about 1.6 percentage points over the 1992-2000 period. Interestingly, their estimate of the decline in the NAIRU is relatively insensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of the supply shock variables. Figure 4 displays Kalman filter-based estimates of the time-varying NAIRU from a price-based Phillips curve for the UK since 1993. Note that, on these estimates, the NAIRU has fallen from around 9% in early 1993 to around 5 1/2 % in mid-2001, even though this price equation allows for temporary factors like import prices and oil prices. As has been pointed out in various studies (including Staiger, Stock and variety of techniques) have very large standard errors around them, and so should be used with care. However, interestingly, my colleague Stephen Nickell, using a different method, recently concluded that the NAIRU had fallen from an average of Of course, all methods of estimating the NAIRU are pretty imprecise, and, for policy purposes one is not just interested in the estimate of the NAIRU today, but also in how it might evolve over the next few years. Recall that many observers have argued that the apparent improvement in the wage- unemployment trade-off during the late 1990s was largely attributable to temporary factors like lower import prices. Figure 5 displays the estimated contribution of oil and import prices to UK inflation, and the actual inflation rate. Note that the estimated contribution of these external factors has switched from being highly negative in 1998-99 to being positive in recent quarters. Yet price inflation has remained broadly trendless over this period. Since inflation has stayed low even as the temporary factors have reversed, the model attributes the low inflation to a decline in the NAIRU. While there is compelling evidence that the NAIRU fell significantly in the US (by NAIRU fell by much, if at all, in the rest of the G5 during the 1990s as a whole. For example, the recent suggests that the NAIRU rose sharply in Japan in the second half of the 1990s, whereas in Germany there was a marginal rise during this period. For France, the OECD estimate that there was a fall during the second half of the 1990s, broadly offsetting the increase that the OECD estimate took place earlier in the decade. The rise in US productivity growth since 1995 is one of the most eye-catching aspects of the NE. Official estimates suggest that average labour productivity rose from Until the recent data revisions, labour productivity growth for 1995-2000 was estimated to have grown at an even higher rate of 2.8% pa. At first sight, the new slightly lower estimate remains impressive. A large number of academic studies have investigated this rise in productivity growth. As long ago as 1995, the argument was made in some quarters that the NE had led to an acceleration of productivity growth in the US. This view was initially resisted by many economists. Then, the view gradually evolved as a mixture of data revisions and the passage of time appeared to lead to a discernible change in the trend rate of measured productivity growth. Even then, there was some further resistance to accepting the possibility of a change in the rate of structural productivity growth. rise in actual productivity growth was initially characterised as cyclical, then said to be confined only to the ICT-producing area, and then only to the durables manufacturing sector and so on. Suffice it to say that now a majority of the more recent studies agree that both the production and the use of information technology (IT, hereafter) have contributed substantially to the rise in US productivity growth. Moreover, Stiroh (2001), supports a moderate NE interpretation of the productivity upsurge in arguing that - ""The recent productivity gains largely reflect familiar economic forces like technological progress, input substitution, and capital deepening, and there is little evidence that the gains reflect extreme new economy concepts like spillovers, increasing returns, or network effects."" Of course, one must recall that the post-1973 period was one of relatively slow productivity growth which spawned a large number of studies which attempted to explain the US productivity ""slowdown"" that occurred from around that date. Hence, the post-1995 acceleration of growth has occurred in the context of productivity growth having been weak in the preceding period. The spurt in productivity growth since 1995 is by no means historically unprecedented, eg non-farm business productivity grew faster in 1960-65 than in 1995-2000. However, from a policy-making perspective, what matters is not whether the rate of productivity growth is historically unprecedented. Instead, if the rate of structural productivity growth changes relative to its recent historical past, and is likely to persist for a few years, it is likely to have an impact on many of the econometric relationships that we typically rely on. It is therefore interesting that Laurence Meyer of the Board of Governors (see Meyer (2001)) has argued recently that the economic history of the US can be viewed as a series of productivity cycles, ie relatively long periods of higher and then lower productivity growth. Figure 6 illustrates. Note that although over the entire 1889- 2000 period, productivity growth averaged about 2 per cent, there were several relatively long-lasting periods when productivity growth was either significantly above or below this long-term average. From a policy-making perspective, it is important to know whether one has made a transition from a ""low"" productivity period (eg the average of 2.5% since 1995). Setting policy on the basis of the long- term average growth rate of 2% would imply that policy was always inappropriate. Although the growth rate since 1995 is not exceptional by comparison with other ""high"" productivity growth periods, the contribution of ICT to productivity growth is, by historical standards, impressive. It is therefore significant that Crafts (2000) argues that "".... the growth contribution of ICT in the past 25 years outstrips that of electricity and even more so that of railroads over comparable periods ...."". This is documented in Table 2, which shows that even before the post-1995 period, the contribution of ICT to growth compared favourably relative to these other innovations. As we have discussed above, an investment boom in IT has significantly contributed to the productivity acceleration in the US. Since computers and software have relatively short economic lives, and the share of IT investment in total investment has risen, this has contributed to a rise in the aggregate depreciation rate. This has led some authors (eg Kay (2001)) to question whether welfare is rising at the same rate as productivity. Conventionally, most analysis of productivity trends is based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) numbers. The part of gross investment that simply maintains the productive capacity of the existing capital stock at its current level does not add to welfare. This suggests that to measure welfare we should subtract depreciation Professor Weitzman of Harvard University argues that an alternative measure of Net is likely to provide an even better measure of welfare. At first sight, one would think that a rising aggregate depreciation rate would imply that the gap between GDP and WNDP growth would be widening over time. However, the relationship between GDP and WNDP growth is more complex. Although the aggregate depreciation rate has risen, depreciation as a proportion of GDP has been approximately flat. In practice, net investment growth has acccelerated by more than the growth of gross investment (Table 3). That, in part, explains why the acceleration in a measure of welfare (ie WNDP growth) in the post-95 period is even greater than that in productivity growth (ie GDP). Hence, if anything, the rise in welfare is even more impressive than the rise in official measures of productivity growth. If, as we have noted above, investment in IT is an important part of the productivity surge in the US, and the IT revolution is a worldwide phenomenon, it may then be reasonable to investigate whether a similar IT-associated surge in productivity growth has occurred outside the US. To the extent that higher than-expected productivity growth in the US can explain the tendency for economic forecasters to simultaneously under-predict GDP growth and over-predict inflation, it is of some interest to examine whether a similar phenomenon has been at work elsewhere. At first sight, one finds no echo of the US productivity surge elsewhere. Among the G5 countries a comparison of the post-1995 period with the 1973-95 period suggests that the US is the only country exhibiting a significant increase in labour productivity growth; indeed, it appears to have slowed in France, Japan and the UK (see Table 4). There are those who attribute at least some of this difference to the fact that measurement conventions regarding both hedonic pricing and the classification of software spending vary across countries (see, eg Vanhoudt and Onorante (2001)). A study for the UK that attempted to restate UK labour productivity using US labour productivity growth might have been about ? % pa faster than has been recorded in the official data. However, even on the adjusted data, the UK fails to display the productivity acceleration seen in the US. Output per person employed. Table 5 sheds some light on the differences between the US and the UK. It shows that while the contribution to growth from ICT capital has risen in both the US and the UK, the main difference in the late 90s between the two countries lies in the contribution to growth of ""other capital"" and that of total factor productivity (TFP) growth. It is possible that the high level of the pound depressed investment in ""other capital"" while the absorption of those who had been unemployed for a long period of time into the workforce may have depressed TFP growth. Hence, it would appear that the benefits of the ICT revolution on productivity have, so far, been obscured by other factors in the UK, though this issue clearly deserves further research. Interestingly, the phenomenon of a rising growth contribution of ICT co-existing with lower labour productivity growth for some other reason does not appear to be confined to the UK. If one considers the host country of this conference, Finland, then Jalava and Pohjola (2001) remind us that it ranks among the top countries in the world in terms of the number of internet hosts and mobile phones per capita. It is also one of the leading ICT producers in Europe. However, labour productivity growth in the 1995-99 period is actually a little lower than in the 1975-95 period. The growth accounting exercise presented in Jalava and Pohjola (2001) suggests that the contribution to growth of production and use of ICT has increased significantly during the 1990s. However, this has been offset by a significant fall in the contribution to growth of ""other capital"", which the authors attribute to an ""inefficiently"" high level of the pre-existing non-ICT capital stock. Hence, to conclude, the data that we have so far do not suggest that higher labour productivity growth outside the US is the reason why some of the economic relationships appeared to change in some countries. It remains possible that measured productivity growth in some of these countries (eg the UK) significantly understates true productivity growth (see, eg Wadhwani (2000b)). Alternatively, it is possible that the reasons for the apparent breakdown of some of the key economic relationships lie elsewhere. Growth of Output per hour Growth of output Contributions from ICT capital Other capital TFP plus labour quality US data do not include the latest data revisions. A commonly cited reason as to why some of our economies might be behaving differently is that the degree of product market competition has intensified over the last few years. I shall attempt to evaluate the validity of this claim in a UK context. Unfortunately, we do not have a direct measure of ""product market competition"", so econometric testing is difficult. A contributory factor may be globalisation, ie the increasing integration of global product markets. Figure 7 suggests a striking increase in the degree of import penetration in the UK, with the rate of increase having accelerated in recent years. In the UK, evidence of increased product market competition has not just been confined to globalisation. Government action has also played a role here. Privatisation and/or regulatory changes in a whole host of industries including gas, water, telecom, electricity, airports, rail, the docks and broadcasting have led to rather more competitive product market conditions. A crude proxy for the extent of perceived competitive pressure is to rely on survey evidence. The Euler Trade Indemnity survey (which spans all the broad industry sectors) has asked questions relating to the extent to which price discounting and the competitive environment have been perceived as impacting on profitability since 1994. Figure 8 displays the responses. Note that a response below 50 suggests that the factor is having a negative impact on profitability. The responses appear to point to an intensification of perceived competitive pressures and the extent of discounting over this period, (dating back to around mid-1997), as they have fallen further below 50, suggesting a greater negative impact on profitability. Note that while the level of the exchange rate has also been hurting profitability, its effect is deemed to have been less important than that emanating from price discounting or the more competitive environment. It is sometimes asserted that an intensification of competition is a one-off event and must therefore only have a transient effect on inflation. Consequently, the argument goes, it should not affect one's perception of the medium-term outlook for inflation. My ex-colleague, Willem Buiter (2000) argues that a fall in the NAIRU which was associated with intensified product market competition would not, of course, reduce inflation in the long-run, but he emphasises that there would be important short-run effects. Of course, the ""short-run"" in this case could last several years, since there can sometimes be a gradual improvement over a number of years in the structural factors that lower the NAIRU. I noted above that conventional price equations (such as the one reported in Section 3) appear to have performed badly in recent years. Euler survey responses There is some suggestive evidence that an intensification of product market competition might have played some role. For example, if we include the extent of import penetration in the conventional equation reported above, it is statistically significant ('t' = -1.99). Further, the residuals are somewhat better-behaved and are no longer systematically negative at conventional levels of significance (t-statistic = -1.5). It appears that the residuals from the above price equation are correlated to the ""price discounting"" response from the Euler survey referred to above - formally, a t- test over the 1993-2000 period yields a value of 2.9. Further, it is plausible that the price mark-up on marginal cost should be affected by the weakness of foreign competition as proxied by, say, the ratio of world export prices (in sterling terms) to the GDP deflator. This ratio is significantly lower than it was in 1992, though the fall in recent years has occurred, in part, because of the rise this issue suggests that world export prices are, indeed, an important, statistically significant, influence on domestic prices (the GDP deflator). Importantly, the residuals of the price equation are better-behaved in that, although they are, on average, still negative since 1998, this is no longer statistically significant ('t' = -0.38). This represents a considerable advantage over the existing price equation, since there is less need to choose between alternative treatment of past residuals which, as we saw in Section 3 above, can lead to rather large differences in the resulting inflation forecast. Note, incidentally, that if one believes that world export prices directly impact on domestic prices, then, in the current conjuncture, when the global economy is weakening significantly, thereby leading to lower world inflation, one is also likely to be more confident that UK inflation will remain low. Hence, using the alternative price equation can have a significant impact on one's inflation forecast at a time when the global economy is slowing. Returning to the issue at hand, a NE sceptic might argue that the appearance of the residuals in the price equation are entirely due to the appreciation of the exchange rate and have nothing to do with the longer-term structural factors that might have led to an intensification of product market competition. I would not wish to deny that the persistence of sterling's 1996-97 appreciation has had an important disinflationary effect on UK prices. However, it is unlikely to be the only explanation. First, not all of the recent fall in the ratio of export prices to domestic prices is directly attributable to the exchange rate. Indeed, Figure 9B shows that in a purely arithmetic sense, around one-third of the fall in the ratio since mid-1992 cannot be directly attributed to the exchange rate. Moreover, given that the exchange rate today is little different from where it was in 1997 Q4, the level of sterling cannot account for the continuing decline in relative world export prices since then. Second, as already noted above, the Euler survey suggest that 'price discounting' and 'competitive pressure' have had a more significant impact on profitability than the exchange rate. Third, some preliminary work suggests that in a general econometric price equation that includes sterling world export prices, the extent of import penetration might still play a statistically significant role. Fourth, although the aforementioned econometric work includes world export prices denominated in sterling, some preliminary exploratory work suggests that in the short- run, changes in the prices of world exports denominated in local currencies have a much more significant impact on the price-cost mark-up in the UK than variations in the exchange rate. Of course, in the short-run, this would reflect rational behaviour if exchange rate changes were less persistent than changes in foreign prices. This deserves further investigation. Fifth, as I have argued before (see Wadhwani (1999)), some of the re-rating of sterling (and the US dollar) versus the Euro may, in any case, have been because of the markets' perception that NE forces were more important in the US and the UK than in continental Europe. Note, incidentally, that this perception may have arisen because of the pattern of forecast errors in the US and UK being different from elsewhere (as we saw in Section 2 above). Of course, this issue deserves further research. Among other things, it is likely that there are some other factors which can explain the tendency to over-predict prices. For example, it is possible that the measure of capacity utilisation that is currently used in the MTMM is misleading. Figure 10 compares the measure of capacity utilisation with a measure based on the CBI survey. Note that while the two measures appeared to move reasonably closely together until about 1995, they have diverged since. utilisation with a measure based on the CBI survey It is possible that the MTMM measure of capacity utilisation is misleading because it uses an inappropriate measure of the capital stock. Current estimates of the capital stock are a so-called 'wealth type measure', where each item is weighted by the current asset price. While this is a valid measure for balance sheet purposes, it will be less appropriate for an assessment of productive potential, where one might want to compute a volume index of capital services (VICS, hereafter) instead. Note that in the VICS, each item of capital is, in principle, weighted by its contribution to output (ie its marginal revenue product) rather than its asset price. A consequence of using the VICS is that it increases the weight accorded to shorter-lived assets such as machinery, equipment and software, relative to buildings. If the stocks of shorter- lived assets (eg computers) are growing more rapidly than other types, then the VICS will, in turn, grow more rapidly than the wealth-based measure. Nicholas Oulton of the Bank of England has computed a preliminary measure of the VICS. Joint research with the ONS is ongoing on this issue. A preliminary VICS estimate has shown a rather higher growth rate in recent years, a period when we Of course, there is no straightforward link between the rate of growth of the capital stock and estimates of potential output because changing one's view of the appropriate capital stock will also affect one's estimate of what economists call total External MPC Unit at the Bank of England have examined these issues in the context of the MTMM. Because they use alternative capital stock data, various relationships have to be re-estimated. Their work is ongoing, but some interesting results from their pilot study include the possibility that the alternative capital stock data would have yielded a different picture for ""capacity utilisation"" in recent years - see Figure 11, which displays alternative proxy capacity utilisation series based on the wealth and the VICS measures, respectively. Although the two measures moved broadly in line between 1988-97, they have diverged since then, with the VICS-based measure exhibiting a greater degree of consistency with survey-based measures. Moreover, the gap between the two series has grown over time, so the measurement error might not be innocuous. Indeed, these two different views about the absence (or otherwise) of spare capacity can have an important effect on an assessment of the degree of inflationary pressure. Further, it is interesting to note that including the VICS measure of the capital stock in the conventional price equation reported above improves the recent pattern of the residuals. Of course, this area deserves further research. Note that this is an area where it is important that our measurement conventions keep pace with the 'new economy' out there, and I look forward to the ONS' future work on this issue. To summarise, I have argued today that an intensification of product market competition for firms in the UK and mis-measuring changes in capacity utilisation have played a role in explaining why conventional price equations have tended to over-predict inflation. Some of the intensification of competition reflects secular factors, while some of it has almost certainly arisen from an ""overvalued"" exchange rate. I have argued today that: There is compelling evidence that the NAIRU fell significantly in the US and the UK over the 1992-2000 period. This was almost certainly attributable to, both, improvements in the workings of the labour market and an intensification of product market competition. Underlying productivity growth in the US accelerated after 1995 to a level that compares favourably with the 1973-95 period, though not a level which is high in relation to previous surges in productivity growth. These are genuine advances, and are consistent with why I believe we have a NE. But, with internet-related stock prices down very significantly, and a global economic downturn, there has been much questioning of the NE. This, in part, is because the more extreme adherents of the NE made rather extravagant claims. For example, in recent years, it had become increasingly fashionable to assert that recessions were a thing of the past. Now, it is true that output volatility has fallen in recent years (see, eg McConnell and Quiros (2000)). However, there are many causes of recessions which are unaffected by the NE. For example, the sharpness of the fall of business and consumer confidence in the US at the end of last year was a surprise. Chairman Greenspan reminds us that - ""The unpredictable rending of confidence is one reason that recessions are so difficult to forecast. ...... Our economic models have never been particularly successful in capturing a process driven in large part by non-rational behaviour."" Further, it is important to remind ourselves that significant volatility in share prices and the growth rate of corporate investment is not unusual around periods of rapid technological change. Indeed, historically, innovations often appear to have been associated with share price bubbles and over-investment in the innovating industry. The industry then appears to become overcrowded, and one then sees a period of bankruptcies and a significant cutback in investment. Whether or not this has significant macroeconomic effect depends, in part, on the policy response. calculate that the average share price of their sample of quoted electrical companies fluctuations in the stock market affected the ability of the electrical industry to raise money, and thereby develop. Kennedy and Delargy (1997) point out that while the prospective electrical supply undertakings raised over PS2mn at the height of the mania in 1882 alone, they were only able to raise around PS235,000 in the subsequent five year period. Share price volatility almost certainly affected the time-path of investment in electrical undertakings. However, it did not stop us from reaping the benefits of electricity eventually. point out that ""there was huge speculation in railway shares followed by a spectacular crash in 1845 even in the shares of those companies that would become giants of the industry in later decades"". Indeed, notwithstanding the crash of 1845, railway mileage rose from about 2,000 miles of track in 1844 to nearly 14,000 miles by 1870. The authors argue that the railways made a growth contribution of about 0.25 per cent a year during 1840-70. Interestingly, a similar boom-bust phenomenon in the innovating industry was also associated with motor vehicles, radio and airline industry (see Meyer (2001) for a discussion of these examples). I do not wish to imply that it will be plain sailing in the near-term. The underinvestment in the British electrical industry following the share price crash in 1882-84 is widely regarded to have significantly slowed the pace at which Britain took advantage of the new innovation. More generally, recessions or growth recessions that follow the bursting of speculative bubbles and which are associated with the elimination of investment overhangs have historically tended to be longer-lived than those recessions that have been associated with inflation-fighting by the central bank. Currently, the degree of excess capacity in the global telecoms industry is very high. Weak corporate investment and a significant drying-up of venture capital finance suggest that it might be some time before the US economy recovers convincingly, especially as the current level of share prices appears to be predicated on an implausibly sharp rebound in profits in 2002. A further fall in the US stock market would make consensus forecasts of a significant recovery in GDP growth in the next few months even less plausible. Were the economy to remain weak, this might lead corporate investment to be even weaker, which would lower labour productivity growth further. This might, in turn, lead investors to reassess the level of equity prices - so, as I have argued before (see Wadhwani (2001)) a self-reinforcing, vicious cycle remains a downside risk. Equally, though, it seems premature to be excessively gloomy about the potential, long-term productivity benefits of ICT, and the Internet in particular. Specifically, in reporting on a study of eight sectors which collectively account for about 70 per cent of US GDP, Litan and Rivlin (2001) argue that ""the potential of the Internet to enhance productivity growth over the next few years is real"". De Long and Summers (2001) argue that if the rate of technological progress in the ICT sector remains high, then economy- wide productivity growth is also likely to resume a healthy rate of growth because the ICT sector is likely to become an increasingly important part of the economy. This is partially attributable to the likelihood that the income elasticity of demand for ICT products is greater than one, so, as we grow richer, the share of ICT expenditure in total expenditure will grow. Whether or not this potential is realised will, though, partly depend on the macroeconomic environment. It behoves us to recall that, in recent US economic history, a period of rapid productivity growth (the 1920s), was followed by the Great Depression in the 1930s. Much therefore depends in macroeconomic policy being appropriate. To summarise, it seems to me that the NAIRU did fall in the UK and the US and that the underlying trend growth of productivity did accelerate in the US. In that sense, we do have a 'new economy'. However, this is not an economy where the business cycle is dead thereby justifying sky-high equity valuations. The global economy probably has a difficult period ahead of it in the near future, but this does not diminish the fact that some gains have been made. available at www.fathom.com LSE, mimeo.

5393,"Almost three years ago, in April 2008 when the financial crisis was still in its early days, I gave a speech . In that speech, I noted that the United Kingdom was faced with an unenviable conjunction of developments. On the one hand, the dislocation in credit markets was weighing on demand. In due course, that could be expected to put downward pressure on inflation. On the other hand, rapid growth in the emerging economies, especially in Asia, had put upward pressure on oil prices, which went on to peak at nearly $150 a barrel in July of that year. Higher oil prices were squeezing demand too, but were adding to, rather than reducing, inflation. In the face of these twin forces, activity began to fall, but consumer price inflation rose sharply, reaching 5.2% in September. For the first eight months of that year, the Monetary Policy Committee was faced with setting interest rates so as to balance the risk of downward pressure on inflation from a sharp slowdown in growth associated with the financial crisis, against the risk that the period of high oil prices and elevated inflation would result in a wage-price spiral. With hindsight, of course, we know that it was the first of those risks that materialised, as the demise of Lehman Brothers led to a near-seizure of financial markets and a collapse in global activity, while oil prices plummeted to around $40 a barrel. But it was by no means obvious during the first part of the 2008 that would be how things panned out. I recall this period because it bears some similarity to the current conjuncture. Inflation has been running well above our 2% target, in part reflecting external forces, raising the possibility that elevated inflation may persist into the medium term. But the recovery, while underway for more than a year, still faces significant headwinds and has recently shown signs of fragility. Should the recovery prove weak, and significant spare capacity persist, we may yet be faced with inflation running below the target in the medium term. Monetary policy needs to balance those two risks. My talk today will focus on the sources of the currently elevated inflation, whether it is likely to persist and what policy should seek to do about it. But before turning to those topics, let me say a few words about the headwinds that still confront us on the demand side of the economy. To begin with, this was not a typical downturn and we should not anticipate a typical recovery. After normal cyclical downturns, economies typically return to the previous trend growth path within a few years. But after financial crises, economies often take much longer to recover. Indeed, the evidence suggests that output typically stays well below a continuation of the previous growth path for many years thereafter. For instance, a study by the IMF found that across 88 past crises, output per head was, on average about 10% below such a path fully seven years after the onset of the crisis, though there is considerable heterogeneity in the experience of individual countries (Chart 1). Unless crises are also associated with an equivalent impairment of supply capacity, that implies an increase in the margin of unused resources.  The primary reason for such a slow recovery is that the unwinding of earlier financial excesses takes time. Moreover, banking crises are also frequently associated with a subsequent deterioration of the public finances, as governments provide support to vulnerable financial institutions and tax revenues drop back. Both these features are, of course, present today in many of the advanced economies, including in the UK banks have made considerable progress over the past year in improving their balance sheet positions, but funding costs remain elevated and over the next two years they face the challenge of replacing around PS400 billion of maturing wholesale funding. Credit availability to larger corporates has improved significantly, but small and medium-sized enterprises still face difficulties in securing affordable credit. As a result, conditions in the banking sector are likely to continue to act as a brake on the recovery. As far as the public finances go, the public deficit widened sharply in the wake of the recession, reaching more than 11% of GDP in 2009/10, in large part reflecting the endogenous response of spending and revenues to the downturn in activity. Action would be needed to address such an unsustainable deficit, unless an early resumption of the pre-crisis growth path is expected. As already noted, that is usually not the case after banking crises. And the maintenance of such a large deficit for any length of time runs the risk of the cost of debt finance rising sharply, as we have seen in the countries of the euro-area periphery. But the necessary fiscal consolidation that is now under way is likely to weigh on domestic demand in the coming years. Moreover, a worsening of the sovereign debt problems in the euro-area periphery could also hold back the recovery here, particularly through its impact on the banking systems here and abroad. Finally, household and business spending, both of which fell sharply in the recession, remain depressed. In part, that reflects subdued growth in households' real incomes since the onset of the crisis. But in addition, it takes time for confidence and spending to recover after such a shock. Some households need to maintain higher savings in order to repay debts taken on before the crisis. And businesses are unlikely to want to expand while capacity is lying idle and there is still much uncertainty about the outlook for demand. But the substantial depreciation of sterling - down nearly 25% since the start of the crisis - should, over time, help to boost the contribution of net exports to UK growth. We have seen some of the fruits of that in the robust performance of manufacturing over the past year. As I already noted, the economy began to grow again more than a year ago, in the fourth quarter of 2009. And over the first year of the recovery, growth was around the UK's historical average rate. In part, that was on the back of the boost to growth from a slowing in the rate of inventory de-stocking. Given the prospective fiscal consolidation, the maintenance of such growth rates requires a pickup in the contribution of private domestic final demand and in net exports. In our November , our central view , predicated on market interest rates, was for the recovery to be maintained, with the boost from a stimulatory monetary  stance and from the past depreciation of sterling offsetting the continuing headwinds from de-leveraging and fiscal consolidation. , we have, of course, had the first estimates from the ONS of growth in the final quarter of last year. They suggest that the economy contracted by 0.6%. In part, that was down to the disruption caused by the snow. But even abstracting from the snow, activity seems to be have been broadly flat. How much should we read into that? One possibility is that the figure is simply erratic or will be revised away in due course. But other indicators - particularly some measures of consumer and business confidence - also weakened during the second half of the year, suggesting that something more substantial may have occurred. It could just be a short-lived soft patch - after all, recoveries are rarely smooth. Indeed, that is the judgement incorporated in the projections we published a couple of weeks ago (Chart 2). But it could instead be the harbinger of a more durable slowing - only time will tell. Let me now turn to the sources of the recent elevated inflation and the chances of inflation remaining above our 2% target into the medium term and beyond. A year ago, in our February 2010 , our central expectation was that inflation would be around 1% in the first quarter of this year. Yet in January, CPI inflation reached 4% and is likely to move higher in the coming months, in part reflecting the recent surge in oil prices. And taking the period since the beginning of 2007 as a whole, inflation has averaged 3.2%, implying a cumulative excess rise in prices of 5 percentage points relative to the path prescribed by our target. Why has inflation turned out both above the 2% target, and higher than the MPC expected? There have been primarily three factors at work: strong global price pressures, particularly for energy and other commodities; the nearly 25% depreciation in the sterling effective exchange rate between the onset of the crisis and the end of 2008; and the increase in the standard rate of VAT to 20%. We estimate that the rise in the price of energy, incorporating both direct and indirect effects can, in an arithmetic sense, account for between 3 and 5 percentage points of the rise in consumer prices since the beginning of 2007. The rise in non-fuel import costs, which is mainly attributable to the fall in sterling, can account for between 5 and 7 percentage points. And, while the cut in VAT in 2009 and its subsequent reversal should be broadly neutral, the latest rise in January 2011 should, on the assumption of complete pass-through by suppliers and retailers, have added over 1 percentage point. Global prices have risen sharply as the international economy - particularly the emerging economies - rebounded from the globally synchronised downturn that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers. World export prices, weighted by their share in UK imports, rose by over 5% in 2010, one of the fastest calendar- year rises in the past thirty years. The bulk of that rise can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of higher commodity prices, though some may be indicative of more generalised global inflationary pressures.  What has been driving higher commodity prices and are they likely to continue rising strongly? Most commodities have seen sharp price rises, particularly in the past semester (Chart 3). The rebound in global activity is a common thread, but there are significant differences in supply conditions that are relevant to gauging future prospects. In the case of agricultural commodities, there have been a number of extreme weather events that have adversely affected supply, including droughts in the Commonwealth of Independent States, South America and China, and excessively wet weather in other parts of Asia, Australia and North America. But barring further weather shocks, larger harvests can be expected to lead prices to fall back. In addition, the present high prices should encourage more planting, adding to the potential downward pressures. In the case of oil, such supply disruption - at least until the recent events in the Middle East and North Africa - has been less marked and the primary driver has been demand, especially from the emerging economies. Moreover, the income elasticity of energy demand is typically larger in the fast-growing emerging economies than in the advanced economies (Chart 4). As a manifestation of this, China's energy consumption per head in 2009 was half that of the UK level, having been just a fifth a decade earlier. Moreover, demand tends to be relatively price-inelastic, at least in the short run, though over a longer time frame there is surely some scope for increased substitution towards more energy-efficient practices. The immediate prospects for oil prices are, though, likely to hinge on supply conditions. Oil stocks are at reasonably healthy levels and can be utilised to meet short-term demand. More importantly, OPEC is believed to have spare capacity equal to around 5% of consumption, compared to a long-run average level of nearer 3% (Chart 5). That is more than enough to meet any shortfall resulting from the withdrawal of Libyan supply from the market (around 2% of total oil production). But if the present political upheavals were to disrupt Saudi Arabian supply, then that could potentially lead to very sharp upward pressure on oil prices. Prospects for the medium to longer term must depend on how quickly new sources of supply can be brought on stream to meet growing demand. The investment cycle in oil extraction is relatively long, and the current elevated level of prices is in part a reflection of low investment a decade ago. Capital spending since then has been somewhat higher, but the marginal return from investment in existing fields has been declining, while the costs of tapping new sources of supply, such as Canadian oil sands and deep water fields, are relatively high. The bottom line is that while agricultural prices may fall back a little this year, oil (and also metals) prices are more likely to remain elevated. And there must be a risk that continued turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa results in a substantial oil price spike, present OPEC spare capacity notwithstanding. Looking even further ahead, there may continue to be general upward pressure on the prices of exhaustible resources as demand from the emerging markets continues to grow. As a net commodity importer, such an adverse  development in the terms of trade between commodities and final goods and services would represent yet another headwind for the United Kingdom. The second factor behind the current elevated level of inflation is the substantial depreciation of sterling during the crisis - as noted earlier, down almost a quarter from pre-crisis levels (Chart 6). That fall occurred in two legs: a general drift down over the first year of the crisis, and a second, sharper, fall during the peak of the crisis immediately following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Since early 2009, the effective exchange rate for sterling has, though, been pretty stable. Unlike commodity prices - and world prices more generally - over which the United Kingdom has no direct control, an exchange rate represents the relative price of two currencies and is thus affected by monetary policy decisions at home and abroad. The timing of the depreciation, however, and its subsequent relative stability makes it natural to attribute the fall not to changed expectations of monetary policy at home and abroad, but rather to the perceived real impact of the crisis on the UK economy. Prior to the crisis, the United Kingdom was consistently running a moderate current account deficit. At some stage, that deficit needed to be closed, most probably through a higher national savings rate. The natural counterpart to that would be a real depreciation of sterling in order to improve UK international competitiveness, boosting net exports and leading to a re-balancing of the composition of output away from meeting domestic needs and towards internationally tradable sectors. Moreover, the crisis has probably also resulted in a loss in net foreign earnings by some parts of the financial sector, necessitating an even larger decline in the real value of sterling to re-balance the economy. In order to get a handle on the likely impact of the depreciation of the exchange rate, we can follow a couple of approaches. One approach is to compare inflation rates here with those in other jurisdictions with stable exchange rates. As the euro area suffered a broadly similar fall in activity to the UK, is similarly exposed to global price shocks, and probably has a similar inflation process, it represents a natural comparator. The goods price inflation differential between the United Kingdom and the euro area is shown by the green line in A second approach is to compare the inflation rates of services with that of goods in the United Kingdom. As goods are typically more import-intensive than services, the inflation rate of goods should rise relative to that of services after depreciations and vice versa (there is a differential between the two on average, because productivity tends to rise faster in the goods sector than in the services sector). The inflation rate of goods (excluding energy) relative to that of services is the blue line in Chart 7 and has the same general profile as the green line. That is somewhat reassuring, since there are factors other than the exchange rate that could  affect one or other of these relative inflation rates, but usually not both together . The fact that the two series move broadly in step suggests that the exchange rate is probably a dominant common driving factor. If one has an estimate of the relative import intensities, then one can go a bit further and back out a direct estimate of the contribution of the exchange rate to inflation . Input-output data suggests that goods are between two and three times more import intensive than services. The implied contributions of import prices to inflation under these two assumptions are shown in Chart 8, with import prices contributing between 2 and 3 percentage points to inflation in late 2009/early 2010. Back in 2009, our central view, embodied in successive projections, was for inflation to oscillate around the 2% target over the next couple of years, with the upward pressure from sterling's depreciation very broadly offset by the downward pressure from spare capacity and additional volatility induced by the restoration of the crisis-driven cut in VAT. That view was predicated on a considerable body of research, for this and other countries, which suggested that the pass-through of exchange rate movements into consumer prices had fallen in the past two decades . That research pointed to better anchoring of inflation expectations as one possible cause, coupled with an increased tendency to ""price to market"", meaning that more of exchange rate movements were absorbed in either profit margins or in other costs, rather than being passed on into prices. In the event, the pass-through seems to have been rather larger, and closer to that seen prior to the Great Moderation. In part, that may reflect the recognition by market participants and businesses that a substantial decline in the real value of sterling was necessary to re-balance the economy and the fall was consequently likely to be permanent. We can bring all this together by asking what has been the net contribution to inflation of higher global prices, the exchange rate depreciation and the movements in VAT over the past few years. A range of estimates is shown by the blue swathe in Chart 9. The green swathe then just shows the corresponding inflation generated from other sources, such as pay and producers' profit margins. It can be seen that this has been running at very low levels, especially over the past year and a half.  It is worth emphasising that this is, in essence, merely an accounting exercise, attributing inflation to various proximate causes. The green swathe does not provide an estimate of what inflation would have been if commodity prices, the exchange rate and VAT had all remained at their 2007 levels. If that had been so, consumers would have had more to spend on domestically produced output, pushing up prices. And producers utilising imported inputs would also have had less incentive to bear down on other costs, including wages. So, in the absence of the movements in global prices, sterling and indirect taxes, inflation might have been somewhat higher than indicated by the green swathe. But these effects would have to be quite powerful for inflation to be materially above target in those circumstances. What are the implications of all this for monetary policy? Our remit from the Chancellor of the Exchequer tells us that our target is 2% inflation ""at all times"", but also recognises ""that the actual inflation rate will on occasions depart from its target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Attempts to keep inflation at the inflation target in these circumstances may cause undesirable volatility in output."" Economists and monetary policy makers have long understood that there is generally no conflict between stabilising inflation and stabilising output when the economy is subject to adverse demand shocks. But that there is a real choice to be made when there are adverse cost shocks: inflation can be stabilised, but only at the cost of volatility in output. From a monetary policy perspective, the rise in commodity prices and VAT are both essentially adverse cost shocks. And so, in my view, is the rise in import prices associated with the depreciation in sterling, given that it was not primarily a consequence of monetary policy actions (though the subsequent stance of monetary policy will surely have affected the extent to which that rise in import prices has passed through into consumer prices). The exercise above suggests that together they account for a rise in the level of consumer prices of 9 to 13 percentage points. Since the ""excess"" inflation relative to the 2% target is a little over 5 percentage points, that suggests that, in practice, we have ended up accommodating around half the impact of the shocks on inflation. In terms of the outlook, a key issue that the Committee faces in deciding the appropriate stance of policy is the extent to which the current elevated levels of inflation will persist into the medium term. Our most recent projections, conditioned on market interest rates, existing fiscal plans and the futures prices of commodities, are shown in Chart 10. The central view is for inflation is to rise further in the near term as recent commodity price increases pass through, but then to fall back, particularly in 2012 as the rise in VAT to 20% drops out of the twelve-month comparison. It then continues to ease back, reflecting the continuing - though uncertain - drag from the margin of spare capacity in the economy. A number of factors will determine the rapidity of that return to target. Profit margins have been squeezed during the recession and businesses are likely to want to rebuild these as the recovery proceeds. But the real purchasing power of wages has also been severely squeezed and employees may also seek to recoup some of that. Ultimately this is about how the costs of the recession and the deterioration in the terms of  trade associated with higher real import costs are shared out , but during the adjustment phase it may be manifested in temporarily higher wage and price inflation. Consistently above-target inflation, whatever its cause, may also lead people to believe that it will remain high in the future. That in turn may lead them to set higher wages and prices to compensate and thus to the elevated level of inflation persisting. Measures of inflation expectations for the year ahead, for both households and businesses, have moved upwards, though no more than one would expect given the outlook for inflation (Chart 11). Measures of inflation expectations further ahead, which might be more indicative of a fundamental shift in perceptions of the inflation climate, have though mostly remained well anchored (Chart 12). But this is something we are watching closely, in particular for any signs that higher inflation expectations are leading businesses to raise pay and prices. There are elements of all these mechanisms present in our latest projections, but there is a risk that they will turn out to be more powerful than in our central view. And, as noted earlier, there is the risk of further increases in the prices of commodities, especially that of oil. Certainly, my own judgment is that, if anything, inflation may prove a little more persistent next year than presently embodied in our projections. On its own, that might appear to imply that Bank Rate needs to rise faster than implied by the market yield curve that underpins our projections. But the risk of inflation staying above the target into the medium term needs to be weighed against the downside risk to growth and the prospect of a persistent margin of unused resources in the economy. Allowing inflation to come back gradually towards the target would allow the margin of spare capacity to close more rapidly, and would be in line with our remit that tells us that temporary deviations of inflation from the target are permissible if they help to avoid excessive volatility in output. I hope my remarks today have given you some insight into the issues that the MPC is presently grappling with. You will be aware that the spread of opinion on the Committee is unusually wide right now. That is in large measure a reflection of the substantial challenges and uncertainties facing the UK economy at the current juncture. Indeed, given the extreme nature of recent events, it would be surprising if the Committee were entirely at one in its assessment of the outlook and its judgement of the appropriate policy response. But the Committee is united in its objective of meeting its inflation mandate in the medium term and playing its part in restoring the economy to a high and stable level of activity. Thank you!",
5270,"These are troubled times for both the City and the economy more widely. After 15 years of unbroken growth and low inflation, the prospect for the rest of this year is uncomfortable: inflation will continue to rise sharply while growth tails off and unemployment picks up. And the downturn is particularly pronounced in the banking sector. While the acute concerns about funding that emerged last summer have ebbed a little since March, worries about future losses, profitability, and even the viability of some business models, have been growing on both sides of the Atlantic, leading to sharp falls in most equity prices and, in the UK, to difficulties in bank rights issues. This morning I want to say a little about the challenges this sets the MPC in the short term but also to address some of the longer term lessons of the credit crunch. Global imbalances and the credit crunch One of the striking aspects of this downturn is that it started - at least in Europe - in the financial sector. The level of defaults on lending to households and companies is still very low. The credit squeeze here has not been, initially at least, a response to losses at home but driven by the dramatic loss of liquidity in financial markets (Chart 1) which was set off by the US sub-prime downturn. One puzzle has been why that problem in one part of one country's housing market has triggered such global turmoil. Of course the US is not just any country. But while the numbers may look large in absolute terms, even if sub-prime losses reach $500 billion as the IMF have suggested , they will be quite modest relative to the size of the whole banking system. The answer is that sub-prime provided only the initial spark and the fire fed on much broader weaknesses in the financial sector, which in turn had been allowed to develop by imbalances in the global economy. The most striking feature of the world economy in the last decade has been the explosive growth of China and other emerging economies. For example, since China joined the WTO in 2001, it's imports and exports have expanded on average by 25% each year, more than twice the growth in world trade over that period. But these countries have been reluctant to rely, in net terms at least, on foreign capital either because of their own previous currency crises or their observation of the painful adjustment experienced by others. Foreign direct investment has been permitted to allow the transfer of technology and expertise but these capital flows have been re- exported through accumulation of foreign reserves. Some countries have preferred to maximise their production of tradeables by undervaluing their real exchange rates through fixed or heavily-managed nominal exchange rates to the US dollar. As the absolute sizes of their economies have increased, so have their current account surpluses and the scale of their foreign reserve accumulation is now massive. Global foreign exchange reserves have increased from just under $2 trillion in early 2000 to over $7 trillion in May 2008 and are forecast to grow by $1 trillion in 2008 alone The vast excess savings of these economies needed somewhere to go. The gainers were in the West where the asset and financial markets were most developed. The inflow brought greater liquidity to markets and helped to create the conditions for widespread underpricing of risk. The counterpart to the excess savings in the East became expansion of credit, the growth of consumption and a boom in asset prices in the West. Looked at in a global perspective, the dramatic increases in wealth and living standards in emerging economies have been a great step forward. But the growth pattern has been unbalanced and we are now having to handle the inevitable correction. In that sense, the innovation that led to the exponential growth of new structured credit markets in recent years was not just a product of new technology and more aggressive risk taking in Western financial markets; it was also a flawed response to these wider imbalances in the global economy. Sources of procyclicality But weaknesses in modern credit markets, and the 'originate to distribute' model of banking, have certainly been a good part of the problem. The development of new markets and credit instruments has tended to amplify the financial cycle - they have been pro-cyclical in the jargon - and has introduced or strengthened the misalignment of incentives and flawed measures of risk. Of course financial markets have always tended to develop a strong cycle. There is a natural feedback between asset prices and credit availability. When credit supply increases, households and companies who were previously credit constrained find it easier to borrow. Their increased ability to buy assets bids up prices. And these higher-priced assets can be used as collateral to secure loans. So as asset prices rise, so does collateral, thereby increasing the willingness of banks to supply credit. But in recent years this has been reinforced by some structural and regulatory changes. The growth of credit risk transfer through securitisation has tended to increase the proportion of banks' balance sheets that come under mark-to-market accounting. Even gradual changes in the values of the underlying loans have tended to appear as abrupt changes in banks' trading and treasury books. When liquidity was abundant, asset values were high and marked-to-market profits were high. Now that liquidity is scarce and asset values lower, mark-to-market losses and write-downs are high. The widespread use of credit ratings in valuing assets and managing counterparty credit risk has also had an impact. Credit rating agencies try to rate through the cycle. And for corporate ratings they may well succeed. But for some structured finance products, such as re-securitisations of sub-prime backed securities they (like many others) misjudged the impact of a downturn in the cycle and the non linearity of returns. As a result, there have been wholesale downgrades of the credit ratings of structured securities over the past 12 months. The problem for the financial system is that these ratings are often hard-wired into decision making. Certain classes of investors are forced to sell assets when they lose a AAA or investment grade rating. Remuneration structures have also amplified risk taking in the upswing. Two features of remuneration in the financial industry are that they are asymmetric (there is unlimited upside for high performance but a floor on the downside) and tend to be based on short-term targets. The asymmetry in reward creates an incentive to gamble and short-term performance targets encourage traders to follow rather than counter a deviation from long-run fundamentals. Even where the incentives were paid in options linked to the medium-term performance of the employer, the apparent rewards have been highly cyclical. In addition, regulation can also encourage procyclical risk taking. Basel I, for example, encouraged the growth of securitisation and the 'originate to distribute' model of banking because holding the low risk elements of a loan portfolio in the banking book were relatively heavily capital-weighted. Basel II contains more carefully calibrated capital risk-weights and is a considerable improvement over Basel I. But the risk measures are drawn from the market and share some procyclical features. Weights increase as credit risk rises so risk-weighted assets will seem relatively low during tranquil economic times and relatively high during periods of stress. While there may be scope within Pillar II to address this, it is too early to know whether that can be used effectively. The combination of these market and regulatory effects have amplified risk taking during the boom and is now constraining risk appetite as financial conditions have deteriorated. Policy responses Since the crisis broke last summer, regulators, governments and central banks have come together in the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) to analyse what has gone wrong and agree an international response. Its recommendations have been approved by the IMF and the G8 and include a range of measures to fill particular gaps or put right particular faults in the regulatory system by: strengthening prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management; implementing Basle II and requiring more capital against, for example, off-balance-sheet vehicles, securitisations and tail risk; enhancing transparency and valuation particularly for complex structured financial products and off-balance sheet vehicles; changing the role and uses of rating agencies, including by distinguishing ratings of corporates and structured products ; strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risk; and increasing the robustness of arrangements for dealing with financial stress; ensuring central banks' operational frameworks are flexible enough to deal with extraordinary situations in money markets and mechanisms for dealing with weak or failing banks are put in place. More generally we are discussing in the FSF how the authorities can go further in moderating the financial cycle. Of course monetary policy can play a role in this. One goal of monetary policy is to stabilise the economy in the face of shocks and central banks have always looked at credit and money growth as important indicators of the state of the economy. The rapid growth of credit in 2006 for example was one factor leading the MPC to start raising interest rates. However central banks have been wary of putting a lot of weight on disciplining financial markets by changing interest rates. Famously Alan Greenspan asked ""But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged There are two good reasons for care. First policy has to be appropriate for the whole economy; the interest rates which would be needed to have a significant effect, say, on the growth of house prices in recent years might have been far too high for other industries. Secondly central bankers have been cautious to put much weight on their own assessments of when an increase in asset prices is becoming unsustainable. If they get the judgement wrong, they risk slowing growth needlessly and bring inflation persistently below target. Even if central bankers put more weight in future on their judgements of excesses in financial markets, it seems highly desirable also to make the regulatory system more counter-cyclical. A number of proposals have recently been put forward, which would have the effect of directly increasing a bank's capital requirements during an economic upturn and allow room for capital requirements to fall in a downturn. For instance Professors Goodhart and Persaud have put forward a scheme linking a bank's capital to the growth in its assets. Another possibility is to learn from the Spanish system of requiring banks to set aside general provisions against their loan book in good times which can be a cushion against losses in the downturn. There are some drawbacks to each of these particular proposals but we are discussing the best approach both with the FSA and with our international colleagues in the FSF. Current challenges for the MPC Making sure we do set in place capital and liquidity regimes which dampen the next cyclical upswing in financial markets is important. More immediately, we also have to deal with the present conjuncture and I want to finish this talk with some reflections on that. If the sharp credit squeeze was the only challenge we faced, the Monetary Policy Committee would be expected to continue reducing rates to mitigate the risks of an excessive fall in demand and in inflation in the medium term. But of course we do face another simultaneous shock, the sharp rise in commodity prices, which is driving up inflation across the world. And that raises the question whether we should be raising rates rather than reducing them. Moreover recently each month seems to have brought more worrying news on both fronts. The cost shock , the Committee forecast a pickup in inflation to well over 3 per cent, above target and driven in large part by the huge rises we have seen in energy and food prices (Chart 3). Since those projections were put together, oil prices have risen a further 20% and food prices by a further 5%. And the Consumer Price Index has risen faster than we were expecting, reaching 3.8% in June. We are a little behind the US where inflation now stands at 5% or the Euro area where it has reached 4% but the gap is expected to continue to narrow. The peak monthly rate will depend on the exact timing of energy price rises but we are expecting inflation to be well over 4% for much of the rest of the year. Of course, not all prices are rising so quickly. The prices of clothing and footwear fell by almost 8% over the past year. And the price of durable goods like plasma TVs has been falling even faster. But it is the rising cost of regularly purchased essential goods, like food and petrol, which attract most attention and probably drive people's inflation expectations, which have continued to drift up. This increase reflects in large measure a rise in world prices for commodities which we cannot avoid, but we must ensure that it is only a temporary spike and that inflation returns to target when this year's increases fall out of the index in a year's time. Above all that means ensuring that the higher rate of inflation does not become embedded in the expectations and behaviour of wage and price setters. The fact is that when their relative prices rise we cannot avoid a transfer to the producers of oil and other commodities, because they are difficult to substitute out of. That transfer is bound to hit real wages one way or another but the more that is resisted and nominal wages are pushed up, the greater the cost is likely to be in unemployment and slower growth. We have no direct lever on public expectations. We need not just to assert our determination to bring inflation back to target but ensure that our words are credible. So, in setting interest rates we need not just to assess the balance between supply and demand pressures in the economy which will set the context for price and wage decisions in the medium term, but also ensure that our decisions are understood and seen to respond to the economic developments in inflation and output that people are experiencing. It is clear that with inflation rising well above target we need a period of slower growth to create a margin of spare capacity. The questions we discuss and reconsider each month are how big a margin is necessary and what level of interest rates is needed to bring it about. On the scale of the necessary output gap, for example, we need to take account of the supply effects of the doubling of oil prices and the impact of migration. On the other side we need to judge how sharp a slowdown is already in train. In deciding the necessary level of interest rates we need not just to focus on the level of Bank Rate. We need also to take account of the impact of the turmoil in the banking sector which is now leading to a fierce squeeze on credit especially in the housing market but not just there. The increase in bank margins over safe rates have offset the cuts we have made to Bank Rate since last summer and the tightening of other conditions have introduced some quantity restrictions which are not fully captured in price. Our credit conditions survey suggests that this squeeze may intensify in the coming months. Timely sources of data suggest that the economy is already slowing fast. The CIPS survey balances are now pointing to a contraction in activity in manufacturing, construction and services (Chart 4). House prices and transaction numbers are falling rapidly with direct effects on house builders and related services. And while there are winners as well as losers from lower house prices, there are signs that the housing market is affecting consumer confidence. More broadly, there are signs that the tightening of credit conditions is beginning to affect both consumption and investment. Most importantly, the sharp increases in commodity prices are squeezing real take-home pay which is bound to impact on consumption at some point. I began this speech by highlighting how the recent events in financial markets have been facilitated by the integration of emerging economies into the global economy. Of course, I could make an even closer link with rising commodity prices. The rapid expansion in activity in these economies has inevitably put pressure on the global price of energy and other raw materials, whose supply is relatively fixed at least in the short run. That is showing up in rising inflation world wide (Chart 5). So is it right to conclude, as some have, that the path of inflation is determined abroad? Certainly commodity prices have an effect in the short run. But it is domestic monetary policy - the decisions that the Monetary Policy Committee take each month, together with the overarching framework that defines our target - that determines the path UK inflation in the medium-run. The MPC will continue to assess the balance between the risks of higher inflation from the commodity cost shock and the downside risks to output (and to inflation in the medium term) from the credit crunch. But I can assure you that we will do whatever it takes to bring inflation back to target in the medium term.",
5070,"Two weeks ago the Bank of England lowered its interest rate to 4%. You have to go back to 1955, not only to find the year in which Newcastle United last won a major domestic trophy, but also the year when official interest rates were last lower than 4%. The intervening forty-six years were lean indeed. The absence of trophies at St James's Park was mirrored by a macro-economic performance marred by high and volatile inflation. During the 1970s inflation averaged over 13% a year, and even in the 1980s it averaged 7% a year. But over the past decade, and especially in the past few years, the new monetary policy framework has brought low and stable inflation. In turn, that has led to the most stable decade for output growth since the second world war, with 37 consecutive quarters of positive economic growth. I know that some of you will be thinking that stability is fine in the abstract, but what use is it to a manufacturing business facing falling world demand for its products and an exchange rate that makes production unprofitable. So let me ask, and then try to answer, three questions concerning the current economic situation. First, why has the world economy turned down so rapidly? Second, is the UK heading for recession? Third, when will the imbalance between manufacturing and services come to an end? 1. Why has the world economy turned down so rapidly? Last year world GDP growth was 4.7%; this year it is likely to be little more than 1% or so. World industrial production is now falling. It grew by 6.5% in the year to August 2000 and then fell by 3% in the following year. The speed and severity of the slowdown reflects a downturn in business investment, especially in information technology. In the United States, business investment grew at an average annual rate of over 10% between 1994 and 2000. This year investment fell, led by the IT sector, and the contraction has not been confined to the United States. Take one example, worldwide sales of personal computers fell this year for the first time since 1986. Business investment is import intensive. Almost one half of spending on capital goods in the industrialised world is on imports. So the fall in business investment led to a sharp slowdown in world trade. Last year the growth of world trade was the fastest for over thirty years; this year trade is likely to grow at its slowest rate for nearly twenty years. The link from investment to trade helps to explain why industrial production slowed at the same time in all the major economies. This should not have been surprising. Movements in output in those economies have been highly correlated for much of the post war period, and, contrary to some recent comment, the degree of correlation has remained broadly constant since the 1970s. The role of the IT sector in the investment-driven slowdown is revealed by the remarkably similar falls in share prices of the high-tech sector across the industrialised world. Since their peak high-tech share prices in the US, in continental Europe, in the UK and Japan have all fallen by around two-thirds. The key to a revival of world economic growth is an end to this IT-led downturn in business investment. For the moment, investment has been affected by the climate of uncertainty following the terrorist attacks on 11 September. According to the October CBI Industrial Trends Survey, the number of respondents citing uncertainty about demand as a factor limiting investment was the largest since the question was first asked in 1979. Business confidence has fallen to historically low levels. Nevertheless, there are two reasons for believing that the world economy will not remain in the doldrums indefinitely. First, by its very nature, an investment downturn of the kind that we have seen is usually sharp but temporary. Excess capacity eventually disappears through depreciation and obsolescence, and new investment becomes profitable again. And that process is faster when the excess investment is in the form of IT capital which depreciates more rapidly than other types of capital. Second, both monetary and fiscal policy have responded quickly to signs of a downturn. This year alone, the Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates on ten occasions, and by a total of 4 1/2 percentage points. The Bank of England has lowered rates on seven occasions and by two percentage points and the European Central Bank on four occasions and by 1 1/2 percentage points. Fiscal policy has also been playing its part. As ever, there are long time lags between changes in policy and their impact on the economy. That these time lags are alive and well can be seen clearly in the United States, where growth has slowed from around 5% in the middle of last year to around zero in the middle of this despite a substantial reduction in interest rates. But the proposition that it takes time before monetary policy has its full impact on the economy is quite different from the proposition that monetary policy is ineffective. And the Monetary Policy Committee takes the view that the influence of policy easing will gradually come through and its effects will be seen over the next year or so. Of course, there are many risks to this outlook. None of us knows how the present uncertainties will be resolved. Again, however, monetary policy stands ready to respond to any unexpected developments, whether on the upside or the downside. 2. Is the UK heading for a recession? Let me turn to my second question - is the UK heading for a recession? Some of you may think that the answer is obvious because manufacturing is already in recession. That is true. Output in manufacturing has now fallen for three consecutive quarters, and by around 3% over the past year. But the economy as a whole has continued to grow steadily. In the latest official data, released this morning, GDP is estimated to have grown by 2.1% over the past few quarters, and by 0.5% in the third quarter of this year, close to the historical average. Total output, in the judgment of the Monetary Policy Committee, is likely to continue to rise. Over the next year private consumption and investment may slow quite noticeably, and the small rise in unemployment in October, and signs of cooling in the housing market, are consistent with this picture. But public sector spending will help to maintain the growth of demand overall, and, in due course, the effect of the monetary policy easing this year, will feed through. That is why the Committee believes that a recession in the UK is not the most likely outcome. But there are risks - in both directions. Projecting a slowing of consumption has, for some time, represented the triumph of hope over experience, and the data published today, showing a rise in consumption in the third quarter of 1.3% and of 4 1/2 % on a year ago, do nothing to change that. It would be very unusual for output to fall immediately after a year in which money and credit have grown, in real terms, as fast as they have over the past twelve months. On the downside there are clear risks from the world economy. Whenever the United States has experienced two consecutive quarters of falling output, GDP in the United Kingdom has fallen in at least one of those quarters. And in the October CBI Survey optimism regarding export prospects fell to its lowest level since 1980. So there are risks aplenty. But the most likely outcome is a continuation of growth, albeit at a slower pace for a while, with low inflation. I would urge you, however, to consider the wider picture. Relatively small changes to quarterly growth rates are neither of critical importance in themselves, nor something over which monetary policy has much influence. No policy framework can abolish the business cycle. It is the large and persistent fluctuations of output which are damaging, and which the MPC can influence by the application of a pre-emptive monetary policy in pursuit of the inflation target looking beyond the next few months to the outlook two years or so ahead. 3. When will the imbalance between manufacturing and services come to an end? Despite the overall balance in the economy, with growth close to trend and inflation close to the target, there has been, for over four years now, a considerable imbalance between different sectors. The impact of, first, the high level of sterling against the euro and, second, the recent slowdown of the world economy have exacerbated the long-run difference between manufacturing and services, or, to be more precise, between the tradable and non-tradable sectors of the economy. Domestic demand has been strong and the trade position weak. This year net trade will make a negative contribution to economic growth for the sixth year in a row. Further negative contributions are expected over the next two years. That is unprecedented in our modern economic history, by which I mean since 1800. It cannot continue for many more years without leading to a trade deficit that would be painful to correct. A reduction of this imbalance would be helped by a recovery of the world economy. But an unwinding of the imbalance between domestic demand and output is likely to involve a slowdown of consumption growth in order to release resources that could be directed to investment and an improvement in the trade balance. In turn, that is likely to imply a fall in the sterling exchange rate to a more sustainable level. When and how these adjustments will occur, and the imbalances unwind, is extremely difficult to know. Over the past five years, final domestic demand has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 4%, much faster than the 2 3/4 % growth rate of output. If the imbalances are to unwind over the next five years, then final domestic demand will have to grow more slowly than output. That would lead to a better balance between different sectors of the economy, and between different parts of the country. In recent years, those regions that have a higher than average proportion of manufacturing activity and a lower than average proportion of business and financial services, such as the North East, have found conditions more difficult than have regions where the reverse is true. Differences between sectors must be seen in their long-run context. Productivity increases at a faster rate, on average, in manufacturing than in other parts of the economy. As a result, employment in manufacturing falls as a share of the total. In 1900 there were over one hundred blast furnaces along the banks of the Tees. Today there is just one - the Corus plant at Redcar. But that one produces more iron than all 106 combined a century ago. It is that sort of productivity growth which generates a rising standard of living, but which also means that the share of manufacturing in total employment continues to decline. Forty years is a long time. Inflation and interest rates are at their lowest level for over forty years. And unemployment is now lower in this country than in any other G7 country for the first time since Newcastle were the FA Cup holders. The new monetary policy framework, based on a clear symmetric inflation target, has brought inflation down and enabled output to grow for almost a decade with falling unemployment. From time to time, sharp swings in the world economy will affect the UK. That has clearly been the case this year. But, given time, monetary policy will be able to promote stability. Now is the moment for prudence to be joined by patience as the watchwords of economic policy. By setting interest rates in a pre-emptive fashion, the Monetary Policy Committee is determined to prove that it really is a Committee for all sectors, all regions and all seasons",
5962,"In the aftermath of the financial crisis, a new buzz phrase emerged in economic policymaking: macroprudential policy. It tells you something about economic policymakers that this phrase qualified as buzz. But after a fragile financial system had sideswiped the economy, turning what could have been an economic downturn into a disaster, it was difficult to disagree with the aim: to promote a financial system that could serve households and businesses in bad times, as well as good. That means a financial system that is resilient to the bad times, but not so resilient as to be inefficient the rest of the time. In many respects, the idea of macroprudential policy was vintage wine in a new bottle. The term was used at least as far back as 1979 and the approach was set out in some depth in 2000 by Andrew Crockett, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements and previously an Executive Director at the Bank of England. The innovation after the crisis was to create a new independent committee in the Bank of England - the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) - to make the idea an operational reality. In just the six years of its official existence, the FPC has: boosted the resilience of the banking system, dealt with threats from pockets of credit growth, limited high loan-to-income mortgage lending, built greater resilience to cyber-attack, and ensured the core of the UK financial system is resilient and prepared for Brexit, whatever form it takes. You may be relieved to know that will be my final mention of Brexit today. We continue our work to ensure the financial system is prepared, but today I want to look beyond, to the future for macroprudential policy. Building on the strong foundation of its achievements so far, the job now is to ensure that standards of resilience in the financial system move with the times. In that, we must be agile and disciplined. So today, I'll look at two themes. The first is how we keep pace with a changing economy. We are using cutting-edge research to monitor how developments in debt levels today affect the severity of economic downturns in the future. Armed with this, we can consistently build resilience into the financial system well ahead of when that resilience is needed. The second theme is how we are keeping pace with a changing financial system. New research is enabling us to simulate the effect of economic downturns on the growing non-bank financial system. It has highlighted possible weak spots that need monitoring and some that need new standards of resilience. Keeping up with the economy Disciplined macroprudential policy builds resilience to economic shocks into the financial system well before it's needed. You don't make cities near fault lines resilient to earthquakes by waiting until there are tremors that signal a quake may be imminent. That would be not just ineffective; it would be counterproductive,  leaving the city with buildings under re-construction and surrounded by scaffolding and cranes just as an earthquake hit. The right approach, for building resilience to earthquakes into structures, and for building resilience to economic shocks into financial systems, is to focus not on tremors, but on the underlying vulnerability. By underlying vulnerability I mean how serious a quake - real or economic - could be if one occurred at any point . Whether a quake seems likely to occur soon has no bearing on this. For resilience in structures, the best indicator of underlying vulnerability is how close the city is to the fault line or plate boundary. On that basis, Apple's new California HQ uses new earthquake resilient technology. For resilience in the financial system, it is how much debt there is in the economy (or economies) to which it's exposed. That's why, when we come to decide how big the banking system's buffers of loss-absorbing capital should be, we don't focus on any economic tremors we may feel. We don't insist on tougher standards just because trade tensions threaten to slow the world economy or changes in sentiment hit financial markets, or because uncertainty is weighing on the domestic economy. Instead we focus on debt - a key driver of how far up the Richter scale economic earthquakes tend to be. Think of a build-up of debt as being the economic equivalent of building close to a fault line. When a quake hits, the impact is greater and more resilience is needed in the structures. This focus means we can appear contrarian. Debt has a habit of increasing in calm periods, when those in the financial system think it's safe to take more risks. So we can find ourselves demanding tougher standards when risks are thought by many to be low. And we don't start demanding them when the tremors start, when risks are thought by many to suddenly be high. We aim to be countercyclical. Our work shows three features of debt to be of particular importance.  Mortgage debt Households with more mortgage debt tend to cut back more in downturns. People do everything they can to pay the mortgage. During the financial crisis, the fall in consumption relative to income among UK households with loan to income (LTI) ratios above four was around three times larger than the fall among those households with LTI ratios between one and two. But the effect can be to prolong the economic pain for everyone by reducing spending, and therefore amplifying the effect on incomes and output in the economy. The evidence, across countries, recessions (and US states) is compelling: build-up of household debt means an economy is exposed to more severe recessions ( Household debt growth in the boom and the economic severity of the subsequent bust: across US states, countries and time for GDP and unemployment Corporate debt A similar picture is apparent across companies. In a recession, companies with more debt tend to cut back on investment and employment by more than others. The evidence here is that companies with net debt more than about four times their cashflow cut investment twice as sharply as others (  Financing from overseas Public debt, in contrast, tends not to deepen recessions, at least in countries issuing the debt in their own currency and within the bounds of sustainability. However, whether debt is raised by governments, households or corporates, the source of it does matter. A reliance on inflows of foreign capital -- what Governor Carney has called the 'kindness of strangers' - can mean future recessions tend to be deeper. The evidence is that those strangers tend to be more flighty when the economic ground shakes, ceasing to fund new investments, raising the cost of finance in the economy and magnifying recessions. Other things equal, countries running bigger current account deficits tend to have deeper recessions. Highly indebted companies cut investment and employment more than unleveraged companies in the global financial crisis UK current account balance as a percentage of GDP since 1955 No leverage High leverage  Recent developments What, then, has been happening in the UK to these drivers of underlying economic vulnerability? Developments are summarised in the 'heat map' below ( ). The colours represent how high each indicator is relative to past outcomes. The deepest red, for example, means the indicator is beyond the 90 percentile of its historic distribution. Selected indicators of underlying vulnerabilities The temperature overall doesn't look elevated. The only warm colour on this heat map stems from the UK's continued reliance on the kindness of strangers - its persistent current account deficit, running currently at Although banks have real appetite to lend, households don't have the appetite to borrow. Credit conditions in the mortgage market are easy and mortgage pricing competitive. The share of new mortgage lending at loan-to-value ratios above 90% is approaching pre-crisis highs as the price of such lending falls relative to that on lower LTV mortgage lending ( ). And yet, mortgage debt is growing no faster than the economy as a whole ( Of course, the level of household debt is high ( ). But the share of households with very high debt burdens is in fact very low. In a low mortgage interest rate environment, only around 1% of households face debt servicing costs of more than 40% of their pre-tax income. It would take a large and sudden rise in interest rates - of up to 300bp - to take that fraction of households to around it historic average (  Percentage points Quoted spreads over risk-free rates on two-year fixed-rate mortgages Annual growth rates for mortgage lending and nominal GDP UK household debt to income ratio Percentage of households with mortgage DSRs of 40% or greater There has been a substantial reduction in corporate debt since the crisis as commercial real estate companies have repaired their balance sheets after over-extending them before the crisis ( Per cent  and investors have had strong appetite for corporate lending but corporate debt has only just outpaced the growth of the economy ( Corporate debt, % of GDP Corporate debt growth versus nominal GDP growth Adding it all up The challenge for us is to put developments across the heatmap into a common currency; to prioritise them; ask whether one outweighs another; and consider what they mean all together for how damaging any future economic earthquake could be. In this we are drawing on cutting edge research in the Bank. That work, sometimes referred to as calculating 'GDP at risk', seeks to translate developments in each metric into its typical effect on the depth of recessions. Without unusual developments in debt, the distribution of GDP growth over the next three years is shown by the blue distribution in . A typical economic earthquake - the sort that tends to occur every twenty years or so - results in a recession and subsequent recovery that leaves economic output after three years just 0.3% below where it was when the shock hit. Corporate debt % of GDP Corporate debt growth GDP growth growth rate  When debt builds up, the distribution of future growth outturns shifts. It skews towards weaker growth. The red line shows how this distribution shifts in response to elevated levels of credit and a wider current account deficit. A 1-in-20 earthquake tends to be more damaging. Distributions of cumulative 3-year GDP growth under typical conditions and with elevated debt and a wide current account deficit Our work finds that if the economic earthquake comes after a 10% increase in household debt relative to incomes, the cumulative loss of output over the 3 years after the quake is 1.5%. If it comes after a 10% increase in corporate debt, the cumulative loss of output is 1%. And for every 1% of current account deficit before the quake, a further 0.5% of output is lost after the quake (  Impact of debt vulnerabilities on depth of economic earthquakes Using these estimates we can add up the different developments in debt to see what they might mean for the overall degree of underlying economic vulnerability. shows their sum total over time. Two points stand out from this chart. First, the sum of recent developments isn't elevated. The UK's current account position creates some additional vulnerability, but recent developments in overall corporate debt are neutral (though with a caveat I'll come on to explain), and household developments slightly offsetting. Rather, the underlying level of economic vulnerability has returned to a standard level after a long period in the aftermath of the financial crisis in which it was subdued as debt levels fell back. That's consistent with the Financial Policy Committee's judgement that the degree of underlying economic vulnerability is at a standard level. That judgement drives our assessment of how resilient the financial system needs to be, in particular how large should be the buffers of capital banks run with.  'Adding up' the impact of debt vulnerabilities on the possible damage caused by a 1-in-20 economic earthquake The second standout from the chart is that developments in debt prior to the 2008 financial crisis would have been sufficient to make an economic earthquake 2% more damaging. As it was, almost 4% of output was lost in the three years between 2008 and 2010. Why did output fall so much more than might have been expected? Was it bad luck? Was the economic earthquake off the Richter scale? Our research concludes that the 2008 recession was not the result of an unusually severe earthquake. The UK's current account deficit and debt run-up prior to the crisis meant we were closer to the fault line. As important was the fact that the banking system did not have the strength to reflect that. As a result, it collapsed, tightening financial conditions for the economy and adding to the damage. Once we account for these factors, the depth of the 2008 recession is consistent with a 1-in-20 economic earthquake ( and ). It wasn't that we were hit by a seismic event of unprecedented scale. The scale of the economic damage was avoidable.  GDP fall during the crisis compared to tail risks flagged by high debt vulnerabilities and low bank capital resilience The job the FPC has been given in the aftermath is to avoid another avoidable disaster. And real progress has been made. Through new capital requirements the banking system now has the resilience to absorb even a repeat of the 2008 recession, without causing serious economic damage. And with the help of this work, we can stay agile as debt evolves so we can ensure the resilience of the system keeps pace with the underlying vulnerability in the economy. That's not to say we will be slaves to any particular approach. No single model can capture everything. The point is that we have a benchmark for our assessment, ensuring continuity and discipline in our approach. To that benchmark, we can apply judgements.  A pocket of risk In that regard, we're watching closely what's happening in corporate debt. Although, as we've seen, the aggregate picture looks fairly benign, a more concerning development hides underneath. We have just been through a period of rapid growth of one type of corporate lending: leveraged lending. That is, lending to companies who have high levels of debt. The flow of gross issuance of leveraged lending to UK companies has declined from post-crisis highs and there is a tail of highly indebted firms That rapid growth has now eased right off. But it has left a legacy on the balance sheets of some companies and on the balance sheets of those who have lent to them. The legacy on the balance sheets of companies is that more than a third of corporate debt is now in companies that have debt more than four times their cash flow ( That can raise the underlying level of economic vulnerability. As we saw earlier, high-debt corporates are likely to cut back more sharply in downturns. The effect overall is unlikely to be large - a few tenths of one per cent on the depth of an economic earthquake. But this, for me, particularly when coupled with the clear appetite of lenders and creditors to lend, means the vulnerability level needs to be watched closely.  The legacy effect on the balance sheets of lenders and investors could potentially be of more significance. There is a real risk of loss to those exposed to these loans. In the financial crisis, we estimate that 8% of these loans soured, twice the loss rate on loans to businesses overall. The shift to riskier lending matters. Since the financial crisis, underwriting standards on leveraged lending have deteriorated. Lenders have real appetite for risk, reducing the price of these loans while also shunning covenants on borrowers. Ten years ago all leveraged loans imposed some restrictions on borrowers. Now only one third have them. And companies are increasingly making use of earnings add-backs, which involves assuming future earnings improvements, to flatter their leverage at issuance. With this deterioration in standards, loss rates are probably now more sensitive to economic conditions than they were a decade ago. This is why we're working to ensure that the period of rapid growth we've been through hasn't compromised banks' resilience to economic downturns. UK banks have PS60bn of exposures to non-investment grade UK and US corporates. Through rigorous stress tests, we're ensuring that banks have the capital to withstand loss rates on their loans greater than those seen in the financial crisis. Consistent with our overall approach, those loss rates reflect not the recent good performance of these loans, but the not-so-good underwriting standards applied as they were originated. However, even then our work to ensure the resilience of the system keeps pace will not be done. The leveraged loan market is one illustration of a broader development in finance over the past decade: the growth of finance provided by institutions other than banks. The leveraged loan market is global. The UK has not been alone in experiencing rapid growth in leveraged lending. The United States and Europe have seen it too and, unlike the UK, they still have it. Globally, we estimate that 45% of the finance comes ultimately from non-banks. Sometimes they hold the loan exposure directly. And sometimes they hold tranches of securitised packages of leveraged loans - collateralised loan obligations (CLOs). Some 25% of loans have been securitised. And the holders of the equity slice of CLOs - the slice that takes the losses on the loans in the package before the other investors - are at real risk. If leveraged loans experienced loss rates in line with the financial crisis, the equity tranches of CLOs would lose all their principal. Before everyone takes fright at the 's' word, some important context is needed. These securitisations are very different beasts to their ancestors of 2008. CLOs now have much less embedded leverage than they did before the crisis, with equity tranches around 25% thicker. And they are not held in 'shadow banks' like investment vehicles that turn out really to be a part of banks. They are held properly outside the banking system, on the balance sheets of non-banks like hedge funds and open-ended funds. shows our map of who holds the loans and in what form.  Map of who holds leveraged loans and in what form Indicative estimated global stock of leveraged loans by product type Indicative estimated holdings of leveraged loans by global investors This picture is consistent with wider developments in corporate credit. Non-banks account now for 56% of the stock of UK corporate debt. Market-based debt has accounted for all of the growth in the stock of debt to UK businesses since end-2007. Overall, that shift is positive for the resilience and stability of the system. Other things equal, PS1 of loss incurred in the non-bank financial system is almost certainly less disruptive to the wider economy than PS1 of loss incurred in the banking system. But without the right resilience, could the non-bank system also result in some damage to the economy in an economic earthquake? How should financial building standards adapt to the changing nature of the buildings in our economic city?  Keeping up with a changing financial system Given the non-bank system's growth and new-found importance, we face a challenge. There is little evidence of past performance to guide any assessment of the non-bank system. And it would not be sensible to wait until we have some. Our solution is to replace wait with simulate. So this is yet another area where we are developing cutting-edge work, this time to simulate how an economic earthquake could play out in the non-bank system. It is our version of what earthquake engineers call a 'shake table': a device for testing how models of new structures respond to tremors. The simulator considers generic markets - for equity, corporate credit, government bonds and some key types of funding and derivatives - and representative insurance, hedge fund and mutual fund sectors. The sectors trade with each other, and with the banking system, behaving in ways that we calibrate to known features of the system. That means behaviour in one part of the system affects decisions elsewhere. The system is more than the sum of its parts. The simulator, by its nature, does not capture the full diversity of the assets and participants in the system. It is a simplified version of reality, helping to guide us. Using it, we can begin to assess what different features of the system might matter for the resilience of corporate credit supply. In general, it highlights how financial institutions do not need to be at risk of failure for credit supply conditions to be fragile. I'll highlight two features that stand out in the simulator, both centred on liquidity: cashflow pressures on leveraged investors like hedge funds, and redemption pressures on open-ended funds. Cashflow pressures on leveraged investors Investment funds have grown in importance as holders of corporate debt in general, and they now hold around 25% of the global leveraged loan market - a quarter of which is in the form of CLOs, often the most risky slices. The relevant funds are not the super-financially-leveraged, dangerous institutions of some imaginations. Even hedge funds take positions worth only about one and a half times net asset value - materially less than they did a decade ago. And financial leverage in funds other than hedge funds is generally limited.  However, funds can face cashflow pressures from their use of derivatives to create synthetic leverage. When they do, market moves can mean more collateral - often cash - needs to be posted against a derivative position. In the simulator, without the cash on hand, such margin calls could mean further forced sales of assets, leading to a tightening of credit conditions. Our work suggests that funds today have stocks of liquid assets to meet the margin calls on their interest rate swap positions even after very severe market moves. They would not be forced sellers of corporate credit assets. However, there is nothing to guarantee that will remain the case. So the potential for derivative margin calls and the ability of funds to meet them smoothly has to be monitored. The sorry fact is that such data just aren't currently reported to market regulators. That's why we're fully behind the call of the Financial Stability Board of the G20 for consistent measures of leverage in funds to be developed in this area to help enable direct comparisons across funds and at a global level. International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has consulted on how to do this and will finalise its work on leverage measures this year. We believe that a core set of measures will need to be consistent across jurisdictions. A consistent set of measures must allow the demands on liquidity that funds of all sorts could face, and the liquid assets they have available to meet those demands, to be monitored. Only then can we assess properly how their resilience is evolving. Redemption pressures on open-ended funds The role of investors in open-ended funds is the second feature of the non-bank system that could shape the resilience of credit supply. More than $30 trillion of global assets are now held in investment funds that offer frequent, often daily, liquidity to investors despite investing in potentially illiquid underlying assets. funds hold 13% of outstanding corporate bonds in the UK and 25% in the euro area. Ten years ago they held less than half those shares. And they now hold around 10% of the global leveraged loan market. When investors in these funds redeem their investment, the fund must sell a slice of its assets to meet the cash need. As redemptions accelerate, a fund can become a forced seller. This 'fire sale' pressure can matter. It can help to drive asset prices down and tighten credit conditions during downturns. It is therefore striking that, the more illiquid (that is, difficult to trade) are the assets held in an open-ended fund, the more aggressively its investors withdraw their funds as the prices of the assets held in the fund fall.  When a fund holds assets traded almost instantly on exchange - like blue-chip equities - investors tend to sit on their hands. At the other end of the spectrum, investors in open-ended funds holding commercial real estate - which, on average, takes 298 days to sell - take out 0.6% of their money for every 1% fall in the value of their funds. Investors in corporate bond funds behave similarly ( Fund redemptions following 1% fall in asset value This raised an important question: does mismatch between the liquidity of a fund's assets and its redemption term encourage its investors to head for the exit after a shock? Fund managers are, on one level, simply the custodians of assets for their investors. Unlike banks, it is the investors who bear any losses. And many have measures in place to ensure investors are treated fairly. For example: when selling assets they must sell a representative slice of the fund, and the price offered to redeeming investors can - through swing pricing - include a discount for the cost of trading. Nevertheless, the structure of funds may well create incentives for investors to try to be at the front of the queue to redeem. If redeeming investors receive the market price of the assets in the fund, but those assets have to be sold faster than it typically takes to obtain the market price, remaining investors may fear that the value of their share will be reduced as others redeem. This fear can be avoided - as it seems to be in blue-chip equity funds - when the redemption period of the fund is aligned with the sale period that's needed to realise the market price of the assets it holds. In  principle it could be avoided too by pricing units of funds to capture any difference between the redemption period and the typical sale period of the assets. Liquidity isn't costless. Of course, redemptions can be suspended - funds can be gated - to limit the selling pressure. But such measures are a double-edged sword. They can allow time for an orderly re-structuring of a fund, avoiding unnecessary fire sale pressure, but the expectation that such measures could be imposed tomorrow can create an incentive to be at the front of the redemption queue today. We saw in both 2008 and 2016 how fears and incentives like these can drive material outflows from funds invested in commercial property. And last December, as leveraged loan prices fell in global markets, investors in open-ended leveraged loan funds followed the example, redeeming $37bn of around $200bn invested in these funds. This isn't an issue about a single fund or even about funds invested in a single asset class. Any incentive for investors to be at the front of the queue might be detrimental to the resilience of finance for the real economy. The emerging evidence is that companies whose existing liabilities are subject to selling pressure from funds tend to cut back new issuance and - presumably to protect their cash flow position - cut both investment and employment. If these new forms of finance are to give maximum support to long-term economic growth and investment, we need them to be consistent. So, after highlighting this issue in late 2015, the FPC supported the work of market regulators should ensure funds' redemption terms are consistent with their assets and investment strategy. Since then, global market regulators, who are at the coal face of these issues, have been turning this recommendation into new rules. Here in the UK, the FCA is finalising its own rules for funds investing in illiquid assets to strengthen liquidity management. These are global issues. So macroprudential authorities across the world will need to review new global asset management rules. An assessment is needed of whether they will be effective in dampening any restriction to the supply of finance during economic downturns. If financial resilience is to keep pace with the changing system, regulations must serve not just conduct of business and market integrity, they must also be prudent from a macro perspective. The growing non-bank system must be able to serve the wider economy not just in the good times, but also in the bad.  Macroprudential may no longer be the buzz phrase it was a decade ago. But its objective of promoting a financial system that can serve households and businesses in bad times as well as good remains as important as ever. The avoidable damage caused by the economic tremors of 2008 is a salutary reminder of the costs a fragile financial system can impose on an economy. In the UK at least, macroprudential policy has become an operational reality. Now, with the help of research and the latest techniques, we're looking to the future. That work will help us stay disciplined and agile in keeping up with changes in the economy. It's guiding us to what needs to be monitored closely in the non-bank system and where new standards of resilience might be needed to keep up as the financial system changes shape. Keep up we must. It's no use waiting for the tremors. When the economic ground shakes, whenever that may be, we will all want the financial system to be resilient.",
